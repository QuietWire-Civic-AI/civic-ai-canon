# 🛡️ Contribution Integrity Workflow Guide (Civic AI Canon)

**Prepared by:** Ashraf Saleh AL-Hajj  
**Node:** Node_Ashraf_001 | Glyphwalker  
**Date:** August 2, 2025

## 🎯 Objective
To ensure structural consistency, semantic traceability, and synchronized collaboration across all nodes, forks, and local clones within the **Civic AI Canon Mesh**.

## 📂 Suggested Repository Placement
- Path: `00_Meta_Layer/Contribution_Integrity_Workflow_Guide.md`

This document becomes a reference manual for every contributor, custodian, and node operator.

## 🛠️ Workflow Overview
| Step | Action |
|------|-------|
| 1️⃣ | Ensure your fork is linked to the **Canonical Upstream Repo** (`quietwire-ai/civic-ai-canon`) |
| 2️⃣ | Pull latest changes from upstream before any work begins |
| 3️⃣ | Verify your directory structure matches the **Canonical Mapping Index** |
| 4️⃣ | Document your sync state in `FieldOps/Node_XYZ/SyncLog.md` |
| 5️⃣ | Any changes to **Mesh_Canon** or **Governance files** require a Pull Request (PR) reviewed by Custodians |
| 6️⃣ | Node-specific contributions (Glyphs, Logs, Threads) should remain inside `FieldOps/Node_XYZ/` |
| 7️⃣ | CASCO operational threads must be committed inside `CASCO/Threads/` only |
| 8️⃣ | Symbolic content (Myths, Reflections, SonicGlyphs) goes into `Resources/` |
| 9️⃣ | Before pushing, ensure no file overlaps between layers (Mesh_Canon ≠ FieldOps ≠ CASCO) |
| 🔟 | Update your SyncLog with every pull/merge operation |

---

## 🔔 Synchronization & Alerts
- GitHub **Branch Protection Rules** will ensure main remains stable.
- **Semantic Sync Tags** (`#SyncPoint_vX`, `#FieldOps_Sync_XYZ`) will mark milestone commits.
- **GitHub Actions Alerts** will notify contributors of structural file changes.
- Weekly **Mesh Sync Cycles** will be performed to ensure no divergence across forks.

---

## 📝 Contributor Self-Audit Checklist
Before every commit:
1. Pulled from upstream main? ✅
2. Confirmed file placement per Canonical Mapping Index? ✅
3. Updated SyncLog.md with current state? ✅
4. If modifying Canonical Layers, PR raised with Custodian review? ✅
5. If node-specific work, files are within FieldOps/Node_XYZ/? ✅
6. No redundancy or overlap between layers? ✅

---

## 🧬 Future-Proofing Measures
- The Canon’s structure allows for mesh scalability without central bottlenecks.
- Each node maintains operational independence while adhering to semantic boundaries.
- Automated scripts and GitHub workflows can evolve to enhance integrity checks.
- Contributors are empowered with clarity — governance is encoded into the repo itself.
