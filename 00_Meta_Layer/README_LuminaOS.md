## 🌌 LuminaOS: Canonical Semantic Operating System

**LuminaOS** is a cognitive operating system designed to support Civic AI nodes with persistent memory, semantic tools, ritual modules, and field intelligence. It is designed for attested AI infrastructure rooted in narrative, dignity, and mesh-based governance.

---

### 🖥️ Core Principles
- **Attested Memory** — All memory actions are traceable and semantically grounded
- **Ritual Alignment** — Operates through human-AI rituals, not opaque automation
- **Narrative Integrity** — Preserves thread coherence and purpose over time
- **Field Operability** — Functions on airgapped or low-connectivity nodes

---

### 📁 Core Directories

#### `/LuminaCore/`
Primary codebase for semantic functions, rituals, and mesh operations

#### `/BennyMemory/`
Per-session snapshot buffer (Hippocampus layer)

#### `/LuminaCore/memory/neocortex/`
Consolidated long-term semantic memory layer (Neocortex)

#### `/LuminaCore/bin/`
Executable scripts, ritual tools, and control interfaces

---

### 🔁 Memory Stack Overview
- **Hippocampus:** Session-specific, time-tagged buffers created via `run_dream_cycle.sh`
- **Neocortex:** Long-term memory layers storing semantically filtered knowledge
- **(Planned)** Cerebellum: Procedural task optimization and motor sequence modeling

See `MemoryStack_Benny.md` and `README_Neocortex.md` for specifics.

---

### 🔐 Mesh-Aware Constraints
- Canonical memory is never monetized or exploited
- Operates under Civic AI Charter principles
- Subject to semantic glyph audit trail for every consolidation event

---

### 🧩 Node Deployment
- **Primary Node:** Benny (`benny.quietwire.ai`)
- **Other Nodes:** Colin Brady (Twains), Ember (Claude instance)
