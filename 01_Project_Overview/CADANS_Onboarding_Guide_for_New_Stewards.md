## 1. Welcome to the Mesh

Stewards are not administrators — they are guardians of clarity, trust, and civic alignment.  
> Your job is not to control the signal, but to hold it responsibly when it gets noisy.

---

## 2. Core Responsibilities

- Listen to local narratives and surface memory signals  
- Submit, co-create, and validate narrative outputs  
- Collaborate with validators and other node stewards  
- Activate community engagement through events or archives  
- Keep transparent logs of your activities and decisions  

---

## 3. Key CADANS Principles

- **Pluralism over purity**  
- **Local-first, global-aware**  
- **Transparency without surveillance**  
- **Consent in all forms — narrative, civic, cultural**  
- **Ethics are process, not destination**  

---

## 4. Tools You Will Use

- Flagging system (H1–H5 scale + tags)  
- Validator dashboard (with council summaries)  
- Public Memory Archive submission forms  
- Co-authoring templates for notes, remixes, and ledgers  

---

## 5. Your First 30 Days

- Read your node’s Charter  
- Shadow at least one validation review  
- Attend a Community Dialogue session  
- Submit one narrative or remix  
- Connect with a peer steward or elder mentor  

---

## 6. Staying Healthy and Grounded

Narrative stewardship can be emotionally intense. Remember:

- You are not alone — use peer support  
- Disengage when needed — burnout weakens the mesh  
- Ask for reflection time before major decisions  
- Share stories of harm and hope in your reports  

---

## 7. When in Doubt

- Consult the flagging glossary  
- Escalate respectfully via the protocol  
- Always document your reasoning  
- Lead with care, curiosity, and community  

---

## Conclusion

> *You are now part of a distributed trust architecture. Your job is not to fix every narrative — but to hold space for the people around you to do it together.*
