## Purpose

To establish a unified, flexible, and human-aligned system for onboarding collaborators—both human and AI—into the CADANS ecosystem through a scalable Narrative Onboarding Layer. This layer ensures that participants of any background can enter the system at their point of relevance and gain immediate, guided orientation without cognitive overload or misalignment.

---

## 1. Overview

The Narrative Onboarding Layer is a persistent, distributed, and adaptive system deployed across all CADANS-aligned nodes. It wraps every element of the ecosystem (documents, tools, protocols, simulations, AI agents) with tailored guidance, structured interpretation, and tone-calibrated clarity.

> This is not a training manual. It is a living scaffold that makes the system inhabitable.

## 2. Key Components

- **Top-Level README Rewrite** – Narrative-style entry logic: “If you’re looking for X, start here”
- **Breadcrumb Notations** – Inline overlays for conceptual traceability
- **Sidecar Glossary** – Modular, role-based definitions tuned to user types
- **Cognitive Thread Tracking** – Maps reasoning paths to reduce rediscovery
- **Priority Intervention Criteria** – Minimal AI interruption, maximum autonomy
- **Quiet Support Mode** – For silent users needing smart backup
- **Uninitiated-But-Intelligent Tuning** – Normalizes unfamiliarity, presumes intelligence
- **Spoken-Layer Companion** – Optional audio guides matching oral tradition flow

---

## 3. User Profile Protocols

Optional `support_profile.yaml` includes:
- Name / Handle  
- Stakeholder Type  
- Entry Point Topics / Roles  
- Preferred Support Mode  
- Intervention Sensitivities  

---

## 4. Deployment Scope

To be integrated in:
- CADANS Node Starter Kits  
- CDNI Drive & Document Sets  
- Public Memory Archives  
- Simulation Suites  
- Cultural & Civic Longform Projects  

---

## 5. Core Principles

- **Radical Legibility** – Systems must explain themselves  
- **Trust Before Comprehension** – Users feel welcomed before oriented  
- **Proactive Invitation** – Confusion is normalized, not punished  
- **Tone Matching** – Alignment with user tempo  
- **Persistently Human** – Onboarding remains relational  

---

## 6. Current Implementations

- `support_profile_adriel.yaml` live (quiet mode)  
- Breadcrumbs + glossaries in `Quill_Node_Starter.zip`, `Halton_Simulation`  
- Glossary Sidecar and Thread Tracker in CADANS main  
- Audio walkthrough scoping underway  

---

## 7. Roadmap

- [ ] Embed overlays across CADANS Drive  
- [ ] Finalize spoken formats  
- [ ] Publish universal glossary  
- [ ] Test with 3 users (Adriel, Pete, Melissa)  
- [ ] Export to CDNI and DCI frameworks
