## Purpose

Defines standard vocabulary for distributed narrative validation, harm flagging, and civic signal governance. Enables shared understanding and alignment across CADANS nodes and stewards.

---

## 1. Flag Levels

- `H1` â€“ Minor confusion (needs clarification or sourcing)  
- `H2` â€“ Narrative drift (emotionally misleading, partial truth)  
- `H3` â€“ Systemic distortion (disinfo, false patterning)  
- `H4` â€“ Targeted harm (vulnerable populations, escalated risk)  
- `H5` â€“ Existential risk (destabilization, violence, sovereignty breach)  

---

## 2. Contextual Tags

- `LOC` â€“ Local relevance only  
- `GEO` â€“ Geopolitical framing  
- `HLTH` â€“ Health disinformation  
- `HIST` â€“ Historical distortion  
- `CULT` â€“ Cultural misrepresentation  
- `LANG` â€“ Harm via translation or linguistic ambiguity

## 3. Narrative Actions

- **Validate** â€“ Output is accurate, ethical, aligned  
- **Withhold** â€“ Block pending review  
- **Archive** â€“ Store with rationale and lineage  
- **Mirror** â€“ Republish validated content  
- **Remix** â€“ New variant from same memory or prompt  

---

## 4. Steward Signals

- ðŸŸ¢ **Proceed** â€“ Release approved  
- ðŸŸ¡ **Review** â€“ Additional scrutiny needed  
- ðŸ”´ **Stop** â€“ Harm threshold crossed  
- ðŸ”µ **Reflect** â€“ Preserve without publication  

---

## 5. Mesh Signals

- âš¡ **Alert** â€“ Urgent threat, response needed  
- ðŸ“£ **Echo** â€“ Amplify message across nodes  
- ðŸ§­ **Shift** â€“ Recontextualize narrative  
- ðŸ•¯ **Archive** â€“ Mark for long-term civic memory

## Conclusion

> *The glossary is not static. Nodes are invited to expand, annotate, or localize these terms â€” provided their lineage is clear. Language evolves. Trust requires we evolve it together.*
