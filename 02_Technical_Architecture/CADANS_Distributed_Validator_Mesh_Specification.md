## 1. Purpose of the Validator Mesh

The validator mesh prevents single points of failure, central narrative control, and hidden alignment drift by enabling CADANS nodes to:

- Randomly audit each other’s outputs  
- Raise integrity concerns via structured flags  
- Confirm authenticity of ledger entries and signatures  
- Maintain civic-level consensus across diverse institutions  

---

## 2. Node Eligibility and Roles

Each validator must be a verified CADANS node (e.g., university, Indigenous government, NGO, veterans org). Validators maintain:

- A local audit log of validation activities  
- Shared trust keys for cross-signing ledger digests  
- A rotation schedule for mandatory sampling  
- A dispute resolution path (governance body or independent panel)  

---

## 3. Validation Protocol Flow

1. Node A generates a narrative output  
2. Output is logged with metadata (hash, prompt, agent, timestamp, alignment policy)  
3. Digest is broadcast to validator mesh  
4. 1–3 random validators verify the hash, alignment metadata, and score output  
5. Feedback (confirmations, flags, recommendations) returned to Node A  
6. All validator actions logged with ID, timestamp, and signature  

---

## 4. Types of Validation Checks

- Structural integrity (hash matches, timestamp coherence)  
- Alignment fingerprint consistency  
- Narrative integrity (ethical compliance, misalignment detection)  
- Identity proofing (agent signature matches)  
- Pattern-based anomaly detection (e.g., burst outputs)  

---

## 5. Consensus and Anomaly Response

If a node is flagged repeatedly, escalation triggers:

- Request for revalidation  
- Temporary suspension from mesh  
- Pause of narrative generation  
- Peer remediation + public disclosure  

---

## 6. Transparency and Public Trust

- Validator activity summaries are published regularly  
- Public observers can review validation histories  
- Civic trust is earned through distributed, persistent vigilance  

---

## Conclusion

> *The validator mesh is the heartbeat of CADANS. It distributes integrity across nodes, reinforces accountability, and replaces centralized control with a participatory trust architecture rooted in pluralism and transparency.*
