## 1. Purpose of Narrative Validation

The purpose is not to enforce a single truth, but to ensure:

- Coherence with community-aligned norms  
- Mitigation of false or manipulative content  
- Visibility of contested or plural interpretations  
- Shared meaning without coercion  

---

## 2. Multi-Layered Validation Architecture

- **Layer 1 – Systemic Alignment**: LLMs preconditioned with civic norms  
- **Layer 2 – Prompt + Output Scoring**: Runtime checks for coherence, diversity, ethics  
- **Layer 3 – Human-in-the-Loop Review**: Sensitive cases reviewed by stewards  
- **Layer 4 – Cross-Node Audit Mesh**: Random peer reviews for drift detection  

---

## 3. Alignment Criteria Categories

- **Civic Integrity** – Informed, respectful, inclusive discourse  
- **Narrative Pluralism** – Presence of diverse viewpoints  
- **Cultural Sovereignty** – Respect for local protocols and identity  
- **Temporal Fidelity** – Time-contextual accuracy  
- **Source Transparency** – Traceability of claims and citations  

---

## 4. Adaptive Protocols and Feedback

- Filters evolve based on community review  
- Feedback loops update policy heuristics  
- Protocols may shift during critical periods (e.g., elections)  

---

## 5. Integration with Persistent Ledger

- Each output tagged with alignment protocol fingerprint  
- Validation metadata logged  
- Future hashes will cite policy snapshots used at generation time  

---

## Conclusion

> *Narrative alignment within CADANS is a living civic protocol — grounded in community norms, transparent in its decisions, and designed to evolve alongside the societies it serves.*
