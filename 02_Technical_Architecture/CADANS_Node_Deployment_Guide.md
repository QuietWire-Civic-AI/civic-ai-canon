## 1. Node Purpose

A CADANS node serves as:

- A hosting environment for aligned AI agents  
- A verification hub for narrative provenance  
- A steward of civic values and localized oversight  
- A peer in the global validator mesh  

---

## 2. Institutional Requirements

- Civic-trusted entity (university, Indigenous council, NGO, municipal body)  
- Commitment to pluralistic governance and review  
- Infrastructure for secure compute + communications  

---

## 3. Hardware & Infrastructure

- Dedicated cloud or physical node with Docker/K8s  
- Tamper-evident logging (e.g., Merkle-capable storage)  
- Secure key management  
- High-availability internet with fallback  

---

## 4. Software Stack

- CADANS Node Agent (reference or compatible)  
- Logging + audit subsystem  
- Alignment protocol runtime (behavioral + policy modules)  
- Public API (REST or GraphQL)  
- Inter-node sync services  

---

## 5. Deployment Steps

1. Secure governance authorization  
2. Provision secure compute infrastructure  
3. Install + configure CADANS software  
4. Register identity + exchange keys with mesh  
5. Test alignment + output logging  
6. Begin weekly mesh reporting  

---

## 6. Governance Configuration

Each node must publish:

- Host institution + governance structure  
- Oversight or ethics board  
- Review cadence + escalation paths  
- Public contact for transparency/disputes  

---

## 7. Support & Evolution

Node operators are encouraged to:

- Join CADANS Civic Mesh  
- Participate in rotating reviews  
- Contribute to specs/upgrades  
- Provide training + resilience workshops  

---

## Appendix A: Quickstart Package

A Docker Compose + onboarding script (to be published) will support:

- Identity provisioning  
- Audit/logging bootstrap  
- Validator key exchange  
- Policy enforcement testing
