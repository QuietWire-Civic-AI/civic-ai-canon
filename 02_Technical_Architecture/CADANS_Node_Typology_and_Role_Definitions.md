## 1. Node Purpose and Common Features

All CADANS nodes share core responsibilities:

- Host aligned AI narrative agents  
- Log outputs with tamper-evident provenance  
- Participate in validator mesh  
- Uphold Narrative Ethics Compact + local governance  
- Engage in transparency and narrative stewardship

- Narrative sovereignty  
- Oral knowledge transfer  
- Protocol validation  

### Veterans Node  
Veteran-led organizations:  
- Public truth and memory

## 3. Node Role Matrix

All nodes may:

- Host AI narrative agents (optional for Observer)  
- Log and publish provenance records  
- Join the validator mesh (tiered)  
- Collaborate on alignment protocols  
- Report/remediate narrative harms

## Conclusion

> *The CADANS civic mesh depends on a diversity of node types — each contributing to the health, trust, and adaptability of the ecosystem. No node dominates. Every voice shapes the network. Every story counts.*
