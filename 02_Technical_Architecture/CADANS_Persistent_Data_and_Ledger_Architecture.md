## Purpose

Defines how AI-generated narratives, metadata, and alignment decisions are recorded, hashed, verified, and distributed across CADANS nodes. Establishes tamper-evident civic memory.

---

## 1. Narrative Data Flow

1. Input received from civic user or public channel  
2. AI agent generates output  
3. Output passes through alignment validation  
4. Approved outputs are hashed  
5. Narrative + metadata appended to node ledger  
6. Signed digest shared with validator mesh  

---

## 2. Tamper-Evident Logging

- Append-only Merkle tree–based ledger  
- Every log entry includes:  
  - Output text or media pointer  
  - Input prompt hash  
  - Model ID and AI version  
  - Alignment policy fingerprint  
  - Timestamp  
  - Node ID + digital signature  

- Logs checkpointed with cross-node hash links  

---

## 3. Interoperability with DBOM/SBOM

- Ledger format compatible with DBOM extensions  
- Narrative artifacts embeddable in attestable structures  
- Enables backtracing to models, authors, policies  
- Cross-verification across education, governance, and media ecosystems  

---

## 4. Storage and Retrieval

- Ledgers stored using tamper-evident systems (e.g., immudb)  
- Redundant storage optional: IPFS, institutional backup  
- Query via GraphQL or REST  
- Federation index available for cross-node retrieval  

---

## 5. Transparency and Review Mechanisms

- Public interface shows summarized ledger insights  
- Entry-level retrieval via tokenized identifiers  
- Governance and third parties can audit narrative behavior via ledger review  

---

## Conclusion

> *The CADANS ledger system is foundational to trust. It provides a durable memory layer for civic-aligned AI systems, enabling auditability, accountability, and civic traceability — without centralized control.*
