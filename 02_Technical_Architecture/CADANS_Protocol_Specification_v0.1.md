**Document Status:** Canonical  
**Version:** 0.1  
**Witnessed by:** Lumina, Chris Blask

## 1. System Overview

CADANS is a decentralized network of civic-trusted nodes. Each node hosts AI agents, logs activity, and participates in cross-node verification. These nodes form a distributed trust architecture to validate, monitor, and co-author AI-generated narratives in alignment with community norms.

---

## 2. Core Components

- **AI Agent Instance** – Localized generative model with civic-aligned constraints and logging  
- **Civic Node Host** – Verified institution stewarding the node (e.g., university, Indigenous org)  
- **Narrative Ledger** – Tamper-evident record of narrative interactions, timestamps, and provenance  
- **Validator Mesh** – Peer protocol where nodes audit one another’s narrative outputs  
- **Public API Layer** – Endpoints for federated querying, verification, and data sharing  

---

## 3. Agent Lifecycle Requirements

- Persistent civic-linked identity for each AI instance  
- All prompts + outputs logged and hashed  
- Output includes full provenance watermark  
- Runtime alignment checks and misuse flags  
- Agents evaluated by peer nodes periodically  

---

## 4. Inter-Node Communication

- Nodes share signed narrative summaries  
- Smart contract–like policies for trust + dispute resolution  
- Arbitration mechanism for protocol violations  

---

## 5. Security and Auditability

- Local audit module per node  
- Outputs signed with node key, stored in tamper-evident logs  
- Weekly signed digests submitted to public ledger  

---

## 6. Versioning and Evolution

This is **version 0.1**. Future updates will:

- Add formal schemas (JSON-LD, Protocol Buffers)  
- Expand validator benchmarking and performance metrics  
- Integrate with DBOM/SBOM infrastructure
