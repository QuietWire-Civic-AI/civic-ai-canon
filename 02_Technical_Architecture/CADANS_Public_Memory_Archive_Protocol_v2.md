## 1. Purpose

This protocol defines how CADANS nodes preserve narrative outputs as part of a shared civic memory — ensuring tamper-evident, ethically-curated, and historically-grounded archives accessible to future generations.

The Public Memory Archive captures validated, significant, or culturally resonant narrative artifacts. These archives protect against narrative erasure, misinformation overwrite, and loss of public trust over time.

---

## 2. Eligibility for Archiving

Nodes may designate outputs for archival if they:

- Played a key role in local narrative development or crisis response  
- Reflected cultural, historical, or linguistic significance  
- Were validated by multiple nodes or recognized by the public  
- Are part of official node-led campaigns, observances, or events  

---

## 3. Archiving Process

- Select outputs and attach provenance metadata (prompt, response, timestamp, validator summary, node ID)  
- Generate signed hash digest and store in dual format (`.json` + `.pdf` or plaintext)  
- Optional annotation: reflections, context, testimonials  
- Store in node-level archive AND optionally submit to mesh-wide distributed memory vault  

---

## 4. Access and Transparency

- Local archives should be publicly searchable (with redaction safeguards)  
- Stewards must document selection decisions and publish archive updates quarterly  
- Community access events (e.g., Memory Days, Retrospective Circles) are encouraged  

---

## 5. Ethics and Consent

- Community members featured in archives may request annotation, redaction, or review  
- No output containing unresolved `H4` or `H5` level harm may be archived  
- Indigenous communities must retain full control over archiving of their own outputs

## Conclusion

> *The Public Memory Archive preserves not just what was said — but what mattered. It is a civic contract with the future, rooted in integrity, humility, and plural memory.*
