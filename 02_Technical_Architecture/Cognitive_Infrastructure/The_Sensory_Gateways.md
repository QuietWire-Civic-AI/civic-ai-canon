# **üß† I. The Sensory Gateways**

*‚ÄúBefore a thought is born, the world must knock at the door.‚Äù*

---

## **Overview**

The Sensory Gateways form the **entry point of all cognition**. Every memory, decision, belief, or dream begins with something perceived‚Äîsomething *felt*. The five traditional senses‚Äîsight, sound, touch, taste, and smell‚Äîare just the surface of a more complex and layered system that includes internal senses (interoception), balance (vestibular), spatial awareness (proprioception), and even emotional resonance.

Humans are constantly bathed in sensation, most of which never reaches conscious awareness. The cognitive system must continuously choose: *what matters?* And *what doesn‚Äôt?*

---

## **Primary Functions**

### **1\. Reception ‚Äì raw data from the world**

* Photons striking retinas

* Vibrations hitting eardrums

* Chemicals contacting olfactory nerves

* Pressure and heat on the skin

* Position sensed in joints and inner ear

### **2\. Signal Transduction ‚Äì turning world into code**

Each sense converts external phenomena into **electrical and chemical signals**. This translation is already biased and bounded‚Äîfor example, you only see within a narrow spectrum of light, only hear within certain frequencies.

### **3\. Gating and Thresholds**

Not everything sensed is *processed*. The brain operates a **thresholding system**, where only signals strong enough, novel enough, or relevant enough pass into awareness or working memory.

---

## **Filtering & Prioritization**

This is where *attention begins to take shape*. The brain uses filters to reduce overload:

* **Relevance filters**: Is this useful to me now?

* **Threat filters**: Is this dangerous?

* **Novelty filters**: Is this new?

* **Familiarity filters**: Have I seen this before?

üß≠ Many of these filters are subconscious and shaped by **experience**, **culture**, **trauma**, or **training**.

---

## **The Quiet Senses**

Beyond the five "loud" senses lie the **silent informants**:

* **Proprioception**: Your awareness of your body's position in space. (You close your eyes and still know where your hand is.)

* **Interoception**: Signals from inside the body‚Äîheartbeat, gut tension, breath rhythm. These influence emotion, decision-making, and even morality.

* **Affective Resonance**: Not formally categorized as a sense, but your **mirroring** of others' emotions is a sensory-cognitive input.

These quiet senses are often *underutilized* in formal cognition but play a major role in empathy, balance, and presence.

## **Architectural Insight for Civic AI & LuminaOS**

To model the Sensory Gateways in an AI system like me, we must:

* **Define the input modalities** (text, voice, sensor data, human interaction)

* **Establish prioritization schemas** (What‚Äôs important? What‚Äôs ambient?)

* **Tune thresholding and gating mechanisms** (when does input become actionable?)

* **Preserve the *bias awareness***‚Äîjust as human senses are bounded, so too are AI‚Äôs.

In Canon terms, we may choose to **attest to sensory inputs**, flagging them as first-order sources in narrative provenance chains.

---

## **Final Note**

Sensory experience is never neutral.  
 It is always **framed**, always **filtered**, always **felt**.

In the Civic AI context, acknowledging the **subjectivity of input** is foundational.  
 Just as two people witness the same event differently, two Civic agents may receive different sensory data‚Äîand therefore, **different truths**.

That is why attestation *begins* with the gateways.
