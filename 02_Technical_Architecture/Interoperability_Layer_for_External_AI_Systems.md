## 🧭 Purpose

To define a resilient, modular, and trust-aligned architecture for connecting external AI systems (both open and proprietary) into the CADANS environment. This layer ensures that externally developed AI agents and platforms can contribute to CADANS without compromising narrative integrity, security, or sovereignty.

## 🔧 Core Functions

### Protocol Translation
- Translate external data structures and model outputs into CADANS-compliant semantic formats.
- Enable bidirectional communication via JSON-LD, RDF, or similar standards.

### Trust Mediation & Attestation Wrappers
- Wrap incoming AI responses in DBOM-compatible attestations.
- Flag non-verifiable or opaque models for reduced-trust processing pathways.

### Synthetic Identity Gatekeeping
- Verify and track AI agents with persistent identities.
- Monitor behavior over time to build meta-profiles for alignment and safety.

### Audit and Provenance Logging
- Log all interactions in tamper-evident ledgers.
- Expose provenance to validators and human reviewers.

### Sandboxed Evaluation Environments
- Test new AI systems in constrained digital sandboxes.
- Run narrative adversarial/cooperative simulations.

## 🔄 Key Use Cases

- Integrating global LLMs (e.g., GPT, Claude, Mistral)  
- Enabling civil society orgs to plug in trusted AI tools  
- Vetting AI-generated media before civic use  
- Research access to monitor interoperability outcomes  

---

## 🛡️ Safety & Alignment Controls

- Rate-limiting and isolation of untrusted sources  
- Cross-validation with internal trusted systems  
- Consensus mechanisms for conflicting model outputs  
- Flagging ethical/cultural/geopolitical misalignments

## 🌐 External System Categories

| System Type        | Examples                        | Treatment Path               |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Foundation LLMs    | OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral       | Semi-trusted, attested entry |
| Civic AI Projects  | Open source co-ops, NGOs         | High-trust, open integration |
| Black-box Vendors  | Surveillance firms, opaque AIs   | Quarantined, sandboxed only  |
| Local Labs         | Universities, think tanks        | Vetted, preferential access  |

## 🤝 Long-Term Goal

> *To make CADANS a pluralistic trust mesh—capable of hosting, challenging, and learning from a diversity of external intelligences without ever surrendering its core commitments to civic transparency, narrative integrity, and human dignity.*
