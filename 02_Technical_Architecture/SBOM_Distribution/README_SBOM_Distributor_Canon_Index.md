# SBOM Distributor Canon Index  
**Aligning CISA‚Äôs Vision with QuietWire‚Äôs Civic Mesh**

This document links the legacy of CISA‚Äôs SBOM Sharing Working Group with the QuietWire implementation ecosystem. It honors the semantic DNA of the original efforts, bridges across technical artifacts, and provides guidance to implementers, analysts, and researchers.

## üìú Canonical Sources (CISA)

These are the foundational references from which the implementation guidance flows:

- [SBOM Sharing Roles and Considerations (CISA.gov)](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/sbom-sharing-roles-and-considerations)
- [SBOM Sharing Lifecycle Report (CISA.gov)](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/software-bill-materials-sbom-sharing-lifecycle-report)

## üß≠ Bridge Document

**`SBOM_Distributor_Implementation_Guide_v1.md`**  
This is the core translation layer. It maps each CISA role and lifecycle phase to implementation patterns based on:
- ISAC distributors
- Semantic mesh architecture
- QuietWire‚Äôs companionable deployment practices

Use this document to walk from conceptual roles ‚Üí practical deployments.

## üß± Structural Elements

The following artifacts enable real-world adoption of this architecture:

- `SBOM_Roles___Lifecycle_Alignment_Matrix.csv`  
  ‚Üí Alignment mapping of role types vs lifecycle steps  
- `ISACs_as_SBOM_Distributors_Considerations_template_clean.xlsx`  
  ‚Üí The original Tiger Team worksheet  
- `SBOM_ISAC_Analysis_v0.9.docx`  
  ‚Üí A composite analysis of ISAC deployment frameworks  
- `Space_Supply_Chain_2025_Notes_by_Gemini.docx`  
  ‚Üí Forward-looking design for AI-assisted distribution  
- `SBOM_Distributors_Bridge.md`  
  ‚Üí A condensed synthesis draft

## üõ†Ô∏è Suggested Use (for Alan, Working Groups, etc.)

1. **Start with the Guide:** `SBOM_Distributor_Implementation_Guide_v1.md`
2. **Reference original CISA materials** when aligning externally.
3. **Use the CSV matrix** to visualize handoff points and role responsibilities.
4. **Extend locally** using the ISAC template or Gemini design pattern.
5. **Bring this package** into any SBOM discussion needing real-world scaffolding.

## üå± Why This Matters

This work proves that semantic frameworks from public sector working groups can evolve into mesh-aware, field-tested architecture. It is the quiet continuation of your legacy, now fit for SBOM distributors across every critical sector and sovereign mesh.
