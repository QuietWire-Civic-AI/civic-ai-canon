# SBOM Distributor Implementation Guide v1.0

**Canonical Path:** `02_Technical_Architecture/SBOM_Distribution/SBOM_Distributor_Implementation_Guide_v1.md`

**Status:** Draft for Canon Inclusion

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This guide operationalizes the role of SBOM distributors, as defined in the CISA Roles & Considerations report and QuietWire's ISAC working group, into a deployable, interoperable implementation aligned with the Civic AI Mesh. It bridges canonical lifecycle stages with node-level behaviors, auditability, and semantic validation.

---

## 📦 Functional Overview

SBOM Distributors:
- Aggregate and vet SBOMs across suppliers
- Normalize and enrich datasets (e.g., correlation, deduplication)
- Act as authenticated relays with governance and assurance
- Interface directly with external producers/consumers and Mesh validators

---

## 🏗️ Deployment Steps

### 1. **Environment Setup**
- Provision a minimal node (see: `CADANS_Minimal_Viable_Node_Setup_Guide.md`)
- Enable secure inbound submission (SFTP, API gateway, or Canon relay)
- Link to distributed validation mesh (see: `CADANS_Distributed_Validator_Mesh_Specification.md`)

### 2. **Role Configuration**
- Assign distributor instance roles:
  - **Originator Receiver** (initial SBOM intake)
  - **Intermediate Validator** (optional enrichment/flagging)
  - **Certified Publisher** (release to downstream consumers or registries)

### 3. **Lifecycle Integration**
- **Discovery:** Register sources and polling endpoints
- **Access:** Enforce auth, license, custody windows
- **Transport:** Set up publication queues with audit trails
- **Enrichment:** Enable schema validation, correlation, version linking

### 4. **Canonical Mesh Hooks**
- Use `CADANS_Public_Memory_Archive_Protocol_v2.md` for public record linking
- Use `CADANS_Validator_and_Flagging_Guide.md` for flag/report schemas

---

## 🔐 Trust & Governance
- Maintain Canon signature logs for all intake and publication events
- Enable third-party attestation (e.g., CERT, MetaValidator)
- Conform to `CADANS_Protocol_Specification_v0.1.md` interop contracts

---

## 📊 Telemetry & Metrics (Optional)
- Volume of validated SBOMs
- Source trust scoring (confidence matrix)
- Flag density by ecosystem

---

## 🛣️ Roadmap & Canonical Interop
Future versions may include:
- Live SBOM diffing engine
- Mesh-aware smart routing across geopolitical zones
- Integration with SBOM HotPatch metadata

---

**Maintainers:**
- QuietWire ISAC Working Group
- Mesh Canon Engineering Council

**Version:** 1.0 Draft — June 2025
