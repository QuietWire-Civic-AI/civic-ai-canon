## Purpose

To provide a tiered, transparent escalation matrix for addressing misalignment, harm, or disruption within CADANS mesh nodes. Supports accountability, preserves dignity, and enables restorative outcomes.

---

## 1. Escalation Levels

| Level | Trigger Event                           | Responsible Party     | Response Time | Notes                        |
|-------|------------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------|------------------------------|
| 0     | Informal signal or concern               | Node Stewards          | N/A           | Logged as internal breadcrumb |
| 1     | Procedural misalignment                  | Validator Peer         | 48 hrs        | Confirm intent, issue warning |
| 2     | Repeated or unresolved procedural drift  | Mesh Escalation Point  | 72 hrs        | Issue public notice + support |
| 3     | Active harm or systemic failure          | Mesh Ethics Council    | 7 days        | May trigger external review  |
| 4     | Breach of core principles                | Validation Council     | Immediate     | Node may be suspended        |

## 2. Notes on Interpretation

- All interventions prioritize *restorative over punitive* actions.
- Language and tone should reflect respect for mesh autonomy and civic responsibility.
- Nodes may designate cultural delegates to translate protocols into local vernaculars.

---

## 3. Required Documentation

At Levels 1–4, the following must be logged:
- Signal timestamp  
- Affected node and domain  
- Validator(s) involved  
- Recommended action  
- Follow-up timeline and result

---

## 4. Alignment Clause

This matrix may be adapted locally, but all nodes agree to uphold a minimally equivalent standard to ensure trust, continuity, and signal coherence.
