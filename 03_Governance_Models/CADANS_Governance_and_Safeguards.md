## Purpose

This document defines the foundational governance principles and safeguard mechanisms for operating within the CADANS mesh. It ensures that nodes uphold common standards of transparency, decentralization, and community-led oversight.

---

## 1. Governance Pillars

CADANS governance is rooted in:

- **Decentralized Stewardship** – Power is distributed among autonomous nodes.
- **Transparent Protocols** – All operational rules are publicly documented.
- **Attestation-Based Trust** – Credibility arises from verifiable presence and alignment.
- **Restorative Resolution** – Conflict is resolved through alignment, not expulsion.

## 2. Safeguard Mechanisms

| Safeguard           | Description                                                        |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Civic Trust Ledger  | Log of public commitments and violations per node                  |
| Mesh Review Ritual  | Periodic multi-node integrity check-ins                            |
| Transparency Signals| Node must publish data schema, validator history, and governance doc |
| Escalation Matrix   | Used when harm or protocol breach is detected                      |

---

## 3. Participation Requirements

To remain in good standing:

- Nodes must self-attest quarterly
- Nodes must maintain up-to-date charter and validation logs
- Nodes must participate in at least one public alignment ritual per 6 months

---

## 4. Failsafe and Freeze Clause

If a node is compromised or harmful:

- A multi-party quorum can trigger a **soft-freeze** (read-only state)
- During soft-freeze, node cannot issue signatures to ledger
- Review board convenes within 7 days for resolution

---

## 5. Amendments

Governance documents may be revised with:

- At least 3 validator endorsements
- Public posting of proposed changes for 14 days
- No formal objections during review period
