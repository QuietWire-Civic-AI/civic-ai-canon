## Purpose

This protocol outlines how CADANS nodes can escalate concerns or flag alignment drift in adjacent or federated nodes. It ensures mesh-wide accountability while maintaining local autonomy.

---

## Trigger Conditions

- Multiple failed API handshakes from peer node
- Inconsistent or contradictory public ledger statements
- Repeated absence from scheduled civic mesh synchronizations
- Failure to acknowledge Phase 1 escalations from other nodes

---

## Escalation Steps

1. **Initial Signal**  
   Notify peer node privately using handshake channel; log attempt.

2. **Public Declaration**  
   Publish a signed flag in the distributed validator mesh.

3. **Coordination Loop**  
   Trigger coordination window between affected nodes and validators.

4. **Temporary Trust Reduction**  
   Suspend mesh routing priority or validator voting power (temporary).

5. **Resolution & Restoration**  
   Node may rejoin mesh fully after publishing a validator-signed attestation of alignment.

---

## Federation Considerations

- All steps must be logged in each participating node’s ledger.
- Escalation above Phase 3 requires at least one external validator signature.
- Mesh coordinators must remain neutral and facilitate consensus.

## Example

> *The Mississauga node detects misattributed authorship in a narrative posted by the Tkaronto node. After a Phase 1 flag is ignored, Mississauga escalates to Phase 3, triggering an inter-nodal review and publishing the record across the mesh.*

---

## Closing

This protocol balances integrity and sovereignty. It prevents drift, misrepresentation, or manipulation without enforcing centralized control.
