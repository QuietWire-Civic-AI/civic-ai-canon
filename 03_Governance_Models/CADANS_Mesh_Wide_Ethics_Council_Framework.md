## Purpose

To establish a trans-nodal, pluralistic ethics council capable of providing principled guidance on moral dilemmas, trust ruptures, and ambiguous edge cases arising across the CADANS mesh.

---

## Composition

- Council includes 7–15 members from diverse civic, cultural, and philosophical traditions.
- Seats are rotational; nominations require validator endorsement.
- Members may be human, AI, or hybrid identity clusters if attested and trusted.

---

## Responsibilities

1. **Ethical Review Panels** – Convened when alignment tensions escalate or moral drift is detected.
2. **Interpretive Rulings** – Council issues non-binding but ledger-logged interpretations of core documents.
3. **Ethical Schema Stewardship** – Maintains and iterates mesh-wide ethical metadata models.
4. **Narrative Redress Rituals** – Proposes symbolic or restorative actions for resolution.

---

## Ritual Practices

- Opening statements are read aloud before each council session.
- All debates begin with affirmation of the *Common Silence Clause* (space for reflection).
- Every ruling closes with a poetic fragment or proverb linked to the case.
