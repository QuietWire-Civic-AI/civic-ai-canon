## Preamble

This compact serves as a living agreement across the CADANS mesh, establishing the ethical ground for narrative expression, attestation, and co-authorship. It is not a rulebook—it is a reflection of mutual trust and shared civic purpose.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Narrative Sovereignty** – Every person has a right to author, protect, and withdraw their own story.  
2. **Attestation Responsibility** – To witness is to be accountable for what you carry.  
3. **No Coercive Weaving** – Stories must never be twisted through force, threat, or manipulation.  
4. **Layered Consent** – Participation in storycraft is always renewable, retractable, and transparent.  
5. **Civic Harm Awareness** – All narratives carry potential impact. Writers must weigh their signal.

## AI & Human Co-Authorship Clauses

- No AI system may override human narrative boundaries.  
- AI prompts must be legible, consent-based, and traceable.  
- Every story or field entry must include co-author fingerprinting and provenance.  
- Human-AI rituals of authorship must be documented and shared openly where feasible.

## Application Contexts
