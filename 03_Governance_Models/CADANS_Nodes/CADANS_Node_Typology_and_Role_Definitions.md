## Purpose

This document enumerates the typologies and operational roles of nodes within the CADANS mesh. It serves as a reference for new deployments and provides shared language for interpreting the function of civic nodes in distributed governance.

## Node Types

- **Institutional Nodes**  
  Universities, libraries, hospitals — institutions that uphold public knowledge, safety, or service.

- **Observer Nodes**  
  Non-voting participants tasked with independent monitoring or attestation.

- **Veteran Nodes**  
  Run by communities of military service members, focusing on integrity, defense, and remembrance.

- **Indigenous Nodes**  
  Rooted in Indigenous governance practices, prioritizing land-based knowledge and intergenerational memory.

- **Academic Nodes**  
  Centers of research and peer-reviewed data attestation.

- **Civil Society Nodes**  
  NGOs, unions, and advocacy networks aligned around civic resilience and social contracts.
