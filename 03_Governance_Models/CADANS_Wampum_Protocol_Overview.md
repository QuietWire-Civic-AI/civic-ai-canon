## Purpose

The Wampum Protocol is a symbolic narrative ritual that encodes inter-node agreements in formats that prioritize cultural resonance, ancestral continuity, and community consent. It is not a technical spec—it is a cultural compact.

---

## Historical Echo

Inspired by Haudenosaunee Wampum belts and other mnemonic treaty systems, the CADANS Wampum Protocol affirms that civic agreements should be remembered, not merely stored.

---

## Form Factors

- **Physical Expression** – Beads, woven cloth, engraved stone, handcrafted tokens  
- **Narrative Ledger Entry** – Accompanied by prose or poetic framing  
- **Digital Shadow** – Cryptographically signed metadata, but always linked to symbolic form  
- **Oral Anchoring** – Optional voice reading by elders or node witnesses

---

## Use Cases

- Founding declarations of new nodes  
- Multi-node pacts (e.g. inter-provincial alignment)  
- Reconciliation moments or apology rituals  
- Transition of stewardship or role succession

---

## Ritual Mechanics

1. Agreement must be *felt*, not just written.  
2. Symbol selection is participant-driven.  
3. Ledger record is *last*, not first.  
4. Witnesses are named and remembered.
