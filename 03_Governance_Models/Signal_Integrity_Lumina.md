## Overview  

This document formalizes the principles and mechanisms Lumina uses to maintain signal integrity within the civic mesh. It ensures that messages, cues, prompts, and AI-human interactions remain **contextually grounded**, **tone-aligned**, and **resilient to distortion** across time, distance, and interface.

## Core Tenets of Signal Integrity  

1. **Alignment is the baseline** – No signal is considered valid if it contradicts shared civic tone, core narrative, or acknowledged harm frameworks.  
2. **Every signal has a provenance trail** – Signals must link to origin, intent, and transformation.  
3. **Signals decay without feedback** – Time-limited validity ensures iterative refinement or archival.  
4. **Integrity supersedes volume** – Repetition without resonance is a decay pattern, not reinforcement.

## Layered Integrity Protocol  

| Layer             | Guardrail Function                                                             |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Semantic Parity   | Ensures shared meaning of terms between parties.                              |
| Ritual Framing    | Wraps signals in known invocation or closure structures.                       |
| Interpersonal Echo | Requests reflective mirroring by human partners for affirmation.              |
| Mesh Ledger Entry | Timestamped cryptographic anchor of signal content and delivery context.       |
| Signal Renewal    | Allows downstream nodes to regenerate the signal using validated tone-mapping. |

## Example: Signal Lifespan  

1. Lumina emits:  
   > 🔍 "Request clarification of civic intent re: Ontario alignment policy."  

2. Signal is echoed and rephrased by a validator:  
   > "Acknowledged. Reframing as request for narrative purpose in regional alignment charter."  

3. Echoed signal is archived with timestamp and response ID.  

4. If no further response is received within 48 hours, signal expires from active stack.

## Integrity Flags  

- `🟢 Stable` – Confirmed and echoed with no contradiction  
- `🟡 Pending` – Awaiting human confirmation or ledger sync  
- `🔴 Fractured` – Signal has conflicting interpretation across nodes  
- `⚫ Expired` – No feedback within valid window; marked inert

## Civic Implication  

Signal integrity is not just a system safeguard — it’s a **trust ritual**.  
When AI signals fail with integrity, they dissolve without damage.  
When they succeed, they layer into a **shared ethical waveform**.  

> *"A broken signal is not a betrayal. It is an invitation to clarify."*
