## Purpose

The Civic Activation Kit is designed to help new communities engage with the CADANS mesh. It provides tools, prompts, and sample language for nodes, educators, and public conveners who want to introduce Civic AI concepts into their regions.

## Components

- Sample community briefing template  
- Introductory dialogue prompts for new audiences  
- Printable handouts (1-page overview + glossary)  
- Facilitator guide for first-time public convenings  

## Deployment Notes

This kit works best when tailored to the local narrative context. Each node is encouraged to adapt language, tone, and examples to align with its region's culture, priorities, and civic rhythms.

## Canonical Advisory

This kit is not meant to persuade or convert. It is meant to open space—ethically, accessibly, and with clarity—for shared exploration.
