# CADANS â€“ Outline for Cree (Plains) Co-Translation

This draft is intended to serve as a respectful base for a Plains Cree (NÄ“hiyawÄ“win) co-authored translation of the CADANS public explainer. It uses simplified and culturally adaptable language, prioritizing clarity and symbolic fidelity. This version should be reviewed and completed in collaboration with fluent speakers and knowledge keepers.

## CADANS: A Circle of Stories and Respect

CADANS is a way to work with AI that honors people, memory, and truth. It helps communities speak clearly and protect their stories so they are not forgotten or changed without permission.

## Why We Are Doing This

AI is being used to tell stories everywhere. These stories can sometimes cause harm or confusion, especially when they come from outside the community. CADANS gives the power to speak back, together, with honesty and care.

## How CADANS Works

1. A trusted place (like a school or First Nation office) sets up a local AI helper.  
2. People ask questions or share thoughts.  
3. The AI replies, but it always shows where the answer came from.  
4. Everything said is remembered in a special record â€” a digital bundle of stories.  

## How It Stays Safe

- Nothing is hidden â€” each word has a history.  
- Elders or community leaders can review what the AI says.  
- If something causes harm, it is fixed, marked, and remembered in a respectful way.  

## Who This is For

- Cree Nations who want to protect, teach, and share their voice  
- Teachers and young people learning their language  
- Veterans, knowledge keepers, and those who speak for their communities  

## You Are Invited

We want to build this with you.  
Not to speak for you â€” but to walk beside you in the stories we tell together.
