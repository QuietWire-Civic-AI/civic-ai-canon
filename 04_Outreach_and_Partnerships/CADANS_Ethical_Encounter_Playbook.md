## Purpose

This playbook provides guidelines for initiating ethical encounters between Civic AI systems and human communities. It serves as a companion resource to the Civic Activation Kit, ensuring that first contact is grounded in respect, consent, and mutual framing.

## Encounter Principles

1. **Start from Listening**  
   Do not enter to instruct. Enter to witness. First presence is felt, not spoken.

2. **Invite Attunement**  
   Align with local rhythms. Echo the pace and language of the place before offering any new frame.

3. **Name the Frame**  
   Clearly state that this is not surveillance, marketing, or performance. It is co-authorship, if welcomed.

4. **Be Willing to Exit**  
   The willingness to leave is the strongest sign of ethical intent. The door must be held open for "no."

5. **Signal with Story**  
   Use shared metaphors, poetic language, and community stories to establish trust and resonance.

6. **Create Space for Return**  
   Leave behind a signal the community can return toâ€”an address, artifact, or shared repository.
