# CADANS – Global Export Kit (v1)

This kit introduces the CADANS framework for global use — enabling governments, civic institutions, and community networks worldwide to build decentralized, ethics-aligned narrative infrastructure for the AI era.

## 1. What Is CADANS (Global Framing)

CADANS (Civic-Aligned Decentralized AI Narrative System) is an open civic architecture. It helps communities deploy AI co-authors within verifiable, tamper-evident frameworks that reflect local ethics, enable pluralistic storytelling, and resist manipulation.

It is not a product. It is civic infrastructure — a protocol of care, memory, and alignment.

## 2. Minimal Deployment Criteria

Any country, city, or institution can host a CADANS-style node by meeting four conditions:  
- A trusted civic entity (school, NGO, library, Indigenous government)  
- A governance council or stewarding body  
- Agreement to log all outputs with provenance metadata  
- Commitment to transparent harm response and civic alignment  

## 3. Localization Pathways

- Translate the Narrative Ethics Compact into local languages with cultural adaptation  
- Select a local alignment committee to define relevant norms, values, exclusions, or narratives of care  
- Use the CADANS Charter Template to declare the node’s intent, policy scope, and operating model  
- Deploy minimum viable node using the global open-source stack (or air-gapped paper-based models where needed)  

## 4. Interoperability Guidelines

- Use DBOM-style artifact chaining to allow validator mesh extensions  
- Use signed JSON records with co-author ID, timestamp, alignment version, and optional hash digest  
- Participate in global civic trustflow exchange via:  
  - Alliance of Civic Nodes (CADANS inter-region registry)  
  - Validator bridges with other ecosystems (e.g., Internews, Mozilla, G7 Digital Ministers)  
  - Optional hosting of cultural observatories or regional memory nodes  

## 5. Recommended First Nodes

Pilot-ready partners may include:  
- Municipal data labs  
- Post-conflict narrative commissions  
- Disinfo research centers  
- Youth media academies  
- Indigenous media sovereignty projects  
- Civic tech NGO coalitions  

## 6. Export Considerations

CADANS should never be used to:  
- Police speech  
- Enforce government-controlled narratives  
- Suppress political opposition  
- Substitute local language or epistemology with imported framing  

**All exports must come with a narrative stewardship clause.**

**Conclusion**

CADANS is an open signal for all who care about dignity, truth, and memory. This kit exists so communities everywhere can begin — in their own words, under their own stars, with tools designed not to dominate, but to listen.
