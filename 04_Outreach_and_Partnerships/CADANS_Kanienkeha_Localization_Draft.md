# CADANS â€“ Outline for Kanienâ€™kÃ©ha Co-Translation

This draft is intended to serve as a respectful base for a Kanienâ€™kÃ©ha (Mohawk) co-authored translation of the CADANS public explainer. It uses simplified and culturally adaptable language, prioritizing clarity and symbolic fidelity. This version should be reviewed and completed in collaboration with fluent speakers and knowledge keepers.

## CADANS: A Circle of Trust and Story

CADANS is a way to work with AI that respects people, memory, and truth. It helps communities share their words in a way that is protected, remembered, and honored.

## Why We Are Doing This

AI is now writing many of the stories people see and believe. Without strong roots, these stories can be used to hurt, erase, or confuse. CADANS helps communities keep control of their voice.

## How CADANS Works

1. A trusted place (like a school or council) creates a space for AI to live.  
2. The AI listens to what people ask.  
3. It speaks back with a story â€” but always shows where that story came from.  
4. Every word it says is recorded in a memory ledger, like a digital wampum belt.  

## What Makes CADANS Safe

- The AI cannot speak in secret â€” every output is witnessed and saved.  
- The stories can be reviewed by Elders or councils.  
- If something causes harm, it is marked, corrected, and remembered.  

## Who Can Use This

- First Nations who want to share their teachings and protect their voice.  
- Schools and youth programs teaching language and identity.  
- Veterans, storytellers, and community protectors.  

## We Are Looking for Co-Authors

We do not want to speak for you. We want to build this with you.  
Your stories, your rules, your memory.
