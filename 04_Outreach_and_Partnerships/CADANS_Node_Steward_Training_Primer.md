# CADANS – Node Steward Training Primer

This training primer is designed for new node stewards — the civic leaders, educators, veterans, or knowledge keepers responsible for overseeing CADANS node behavior, ethics, and community alignment.

## 1. What Is a Steward?

- A steward is a human accountable for what the node says, shares, or archives  
- They are not tech administrators — they are narrative caretakers  
- Stewards act as bridge between community, technology, and memory  
- They review outputs, handle harm reports, and initiate escalations if needed  

## 2. Core Steward Responsibilities

- Review narrative outputs periodically or on request  
- Approve or reject responses flagged by validators or community  
- Coordinate with other nodes on shared harms or interventions  
- Host public storytelling, education, or alignment workshops  
- Maintain public transparency (e.g., publishing output logs)  

## 3. Alignment Protocol Awareness

- Know your node’s alignment fingerprint and its origin  
- Stay aware of any drift, model updates, or new context triggers  
- Participate in periodic alignment reviews with co-authors and peers  

## 4. Ledger and Output Review

- Use the node dashboard to monitor:  
  - Outputs logged by timestamp, topic, and model  
  - Any flagged outputs (ethical, factual, cultural)  
  - Signed validator feedback  
- Optionally annotate logs with steward context or commentary  

## 5. Escalation Protocols

- **Level 1:** Review and log minor issues locally  
- **Level 2:** Trigger mesh alert if other nodes are impacted  
- **Level 3:** Convene multi-node integrity response (if systemic)  
- Always preserve a copy of the original output and all flags  

## 6. Public Engagement

- Stewards are invited to speak at events, lead roundtables, and host onboarding circles  
- Their role is civic, not bureaucratic — rooted in care, memory, and clarity  
- Recommended practices:  
  - Quarterly stewardship circles with community  
  - Public narrative walkthroughs  
  - Youth and Elder storytelling programs

**Conclusion**

Being a steward is about showing up — for your community, for your node, and for narrative integrity. The system works because people like you care enough to keep the circle honest, visible, and alive.
