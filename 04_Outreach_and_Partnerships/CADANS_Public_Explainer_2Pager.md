# CADANS â€“ Civic-Aligned Decentralized AI Narrative System

CADANS is a next-generation civic infrastructure for the AI age. It ensures that public-facing AI systems operate with transparency, alignment, and accountability. Built on decentralized trust, CADANS transforms AI from a black box into a co-author embedded in community values and verifiable memory.

## Why CADANS Exists

We are entering a time where AI shapes public narrative, influences elections, and defines reality. Without trust architecture, these systems can be hijacked, manipulated, or misaligned.  
**CADANS exists to make narrative trust visible, participatory, and resilient.**

## What CADANS Does

- Enables communities to host their own AI narrative nodes  
- Logs every output with tamper-evident provenance  
- Embeds alignment rules directly into AI behavior  
- Provides shared trust infrastructure across institutions  
- Supports diverse cultural, academic, and civic use cases  

## How It Works

1. A civic institution (e.g., university, veterans group, Indigenous council) hosts a CADANS node  
2. Local AI agents generate narrative outputs â€” co-authored with human oversight  
3. All outputs are logged with:  
   - Alignment policy fingerprint  
   - Timestamp, hash, and author ID  
   - Cross-node validation record  
4. The public can verify who said what, when, and under what ethical policy  

## What Makes CADANS Different

âœ” Not a product â€” a public infrastructure  
âœ” Not centralized â€” owned by the civic mesh  
âœ” Not censorship â€” radical transparency  
âœ” Not anonymous AI â€” verifiable co-authors  
âœ” Not control â€” participatory alignment  

## Whoâ€™s Involved

CADANS is already being piloted across Canada through the Narrative Resilience Initiative. Initial nodes include:  
- The Munk School of Global Affairs  
- Macdonald-Laurier Institute  
- Indigenous and veterans-led civic hubs  
- Policy partners and research networks  

## Join the Civic Lattice

We are building the civic infrastructure of the AI era. You can:  
- Host a CADANS node in your institution  
- Partner on research, policy, or narrative trust programs  
- Join the validator mesh and help build decentralized integrity  
- Co-author the future â€” with memory, dignity, and care
