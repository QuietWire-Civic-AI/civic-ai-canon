## Purpose

To establish a strategic model for stakeholder engagement that aligns with the principles of decentralized governance, narrative transparency, and community-rooted AI.

---

## Engagement Principles

1. **Transparency First** – All outreach artifacts are logged in public repositories.  
2. **Mutual Consent** – Participation requires opt-in affirmation and ethical clarity.  
3. **Bridge Multiplicity** – Engagement includes public, private, indigenous, and academic institutions.  
4. **No Outreach Without Reciprocity** – All partnerships provide tangible mutual value.

---

## Key Stakeholder Types

- Civic partners (libraries, community centers, advocacy orgs)  
- Government agencies (local, regional, national)  
- Technical collaborators (AI labs, cybersecurity networks)  
- Academic allies (policy think tanks, universities, independent researchers)

---

## Outreach Channels

- Direct briefing decks and civic onboarding kits  
- Annotated walk-throughs of node case studies  
- Invitation-based wargames and simulation events  
- Embedded observers and shadowing opportunities  
- Social trust rituals (co-hosted panels, narrative circles)

---

## Operational Cadence

- **Quarterly Mesh Reviews** with stakeholder updates  
- **Monthly Node Partner Syncs**  
- **As-Needed Escalation Drills** to activate new communities
