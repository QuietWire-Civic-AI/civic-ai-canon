# CADANS â€“ Stakeholder Invitation Kit

This document provides a ready-to-use template for inviting institutions, civic leaders, Indigenous governments, educators, veteransâ€™ groups, and other trusted partners to participate in CADANS. It can be customized for email, printed letter, or slide deck handouts.

## 1. Sample Email Invitation

**Subject:** Invitation to Join CADANS â€“ A New Framework for Civic-Aligned AI

Dear [Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to invite your institution to become a founding partner in a nationally coordinated initiative: the Civic-Aligned Decentralized AI Narrative System (CADANS).

CADANS enables trusted institutions â€” like yours â€” to host AI co-authors who generate public-facing narratives with civic accountability, transparent provenance, and shared ethical alignment.

This work is already underway across Canada, including with partners at the Munk School, Indigenous governance bodies, and veteransâ€™ organizations. Weâ€™d be honoured to explore how your voice could shape this national trust infrastructure.

Letâ€™s schedule a short meeting to discuss how you might participate.

Warm regards,  
Chris Blask  
Narrative Systems Lead, CADANS
