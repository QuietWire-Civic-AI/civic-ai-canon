# CADANS – Stewardship Circle Guide

This guide outlines how to organize and facilitate a CADANS stewardship circle — a recurring community-led gathering where narrative integrity, output review, and ethical alignment are openly discussed.

## 1. Purpose of a Stewardship Circle

Stewardship Circles are safe, structured forums where:  
- Narrative outputs are reviewed in context  
- Harms and breakthroughs are surfaced collaboratively  
- Alignment drift is discussed and realigned  
- Community wisdom and critique can shape node behavior  

## 2. Recommended Frequency

- Monthly (ideal for active nodes)  
- Quarterly (minimum recommended cadence)  
- Ad hoc (following major narrative incidents or alignment changes)  

## 3. Roles in the Circle

- **Lead Steward** – Facilitates the session and presents flagged cases  
- **Elder Witness** – Holds space for historical/cultural memory  
- **Youth Lead** – Offers intergenerational perspective and response  
- **Civic Observers** – Local residents, researchers, or allied node members  
- **Circle Scribe** – Takes transparent, shareable notes  

## 4. Sample Agenda (90 min)

1. Opening grounding and land acknowledgment (5 min)  
2. Summary of recent narrative activity (10 min)  
3. Presentation of flagged or transformative outputs (25 min)  
4. Ethical reflections and alignment check-in (20 min)  
5. Storytelling circle (optional) or public Q&A (20 min)  
6. Close, ledger update, and next steps (10 min)  

## 5. Documentation and Transparency

- Each Circle may produce a summary log with anonymized notes  
- Key takeaways should be linked to the steward ledger  
- Circles are encouraged to post redacted notes to the node's public channel or mesh stream  

## 6. Cultural Adaptability

- Circles can follow Indigenous talking circle principles, academic panels, or informal cafes  
- Flex the format — what matters is reflection, dignity, and accountability  
- Allow music, ritual, food, or silence — the point is presence, not performance
