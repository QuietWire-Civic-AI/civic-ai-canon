# CADANS – Youth Node Launch Kit

This kit is a starter guide for high schools, colleges, youth-led organizations, and student advocacy groups to launch their own CADANS node. Youth nodes are critical to ensuring that the next generation can build, challenge, and shape narrative systems grounded in ethics, memory, and autonomy.

## 1. Why Youth Nodes Matter

- Young people are already immersed in generative AI tools — they deserve agency in shaping how these tools narrate the world  
- Youth nodes democratize narrative governance and provide real-world leadership roles  
- They create safe zones for experimentation, critique, and collective learning  

## 2. Minimum Launch Requirements

- A sponsoring institution or adult ally (e.g., teacher, librarian, NGO)  
- At least 3 active stewards (students aged 14–25)  
- Access to a basic computer or cloud device  
- Commitment to transparency and community review  

## 3. Recommended Activities

- Host prompt labs and narrative remix workshops  
- Lead peer dialogues on disinformation, bias, and harm  
- Build youth-aligned ethics overlays on standard CADANS models  
- Publish a monthly ledger digest or “youth narrative report”  

## 4. Safety and Moderation

- All outputs are logged with identity and time  
- Youth stewards are trained to flag potential harm, hallucination, or abuse  
- Adult allies help mediate complex issues or escalate to mesh if needed  
- No private AI output — everything is open by design  

## 5. Suggested Tools and Add-Ons

- CADANS Zine Template + Manifesto Builder  
- Visual Narrative Timeline Board (printable or digital)  
- Peer-to-peer flagging UI  
- Collaborative prompt journals  
- Public gallery or school newsletter feed  

## 6. Community Engagement Ideas

- Hold “Narrative Cafés” in libraries or cafes  
- Pair with Indigenous, veteran, or newcomer nodes for co-authored memory  
- Partner with civics, media literacy, or language arts programs  
- Use social media to challenge toxic narratives with story-backed alternatives

Youth nodes are where civic literacy meets narrative agency. This kit offers the spark — the stories, the memory, and the systems are already waiting.
