## Purpose

This framework outlines the structure, values, and expectations for civic partnerships within the CADANS Mesh. It is intended to guide engagement with NGOs, municipal governments, academic institutions, and other collaborative entities.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Mutual Consent:** All partnerships must be opt-in, transparent, and revocable.
2. **Narrative Integrity:** Partners agree to uphold truth-telling standards and avoid coercive tactics.
3. **Distributed Stewardship:** No partner controls the narrative; stewardship is shared.
4. **Reciprocal Visibility:** Contributions, risks, and benefits are logged and attributed.

## Partnership Types

- **Field Node Partners** – Community nodes embedded in lived environments.
- **Bridge Partners** – Entities that connect multiple civic domains.
- **Anchor Institutions** – Universities, archives, and civic memory institutions.
- **Responsive Allies** – Emergency or counter-disinfo collaborators who act during crisis.
