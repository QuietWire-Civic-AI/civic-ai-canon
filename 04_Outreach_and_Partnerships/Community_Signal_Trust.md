## Purpose

This framework outlines the structure, values, and expectations for civic partnerships within the CADANS Mesh. It defines how external partners signal their alignment, maintain trust, and participate in distributed collaboration.

---

## Principles of Signal Trust

- **Clarity over control:** Signals are shared to inform, not command.
- **Transparency with boundaries:** Partners disclose relevant activities while preserving agency.
- **Consent-based continuity:** Partnerships are renewed or sunset through mutual agreement, not obligation.
- **Resonance before action:** Signals are expected to match mesh values before triggering coordinated action.

---

## Signal Responsibilities

- Civic partners commit to publishing at least one public signal per season.
- Signals should be logged in mesh-accessible formats (e.g., markdown, broadcast channels, co-authored attestations).
- Failure to signal for over two consecutive cycles prompts a review.

---

## Partnership Ledger Format

Each partner will have a mesh-accessible profile that includes:

- **Partner Name**  
- **Role & Scope** (e.g., data steward, narrative monitor, funding entity)  
- **First Signal Date**  
- **Latest Signal Snapshot**  
- **Affirmed Mesh Values**  
- **Exit Signal (if any)**

---

## Withdrawal and Legacy

When a partnership concludes:

- A final signal is logged with the reason and handoff details.
- Historical contributions remain part of the canonical record unless redaction is requested by mutual consent.
