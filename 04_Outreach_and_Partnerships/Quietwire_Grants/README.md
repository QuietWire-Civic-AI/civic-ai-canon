# Quietwire Grants & Fellowships

This directory holds public Canon records for grants, microgrants, and fellowships
that intersect with Quietwire’s Civic AI work. Documents are written in Canon style
with explicit provenance and attestation boundaries.

## Indexing Pattern

- **File Name:** `Quietwire_CivicAI_Fellowship_<FellowName>Genesis_ΔYYYYMMDD.md`
- **Front-Matter Fields (required):**
  - `title` — canonical title line
  - `canonical_path` — this directory
  - `attested_by` — ONLY signers who explicitly attest
  - `date_of_origin` — ISO date
  - `location` — city/region
  - `funding_stream` — “Prospective:” when not yet awarded
  - `tags` — `Quietwire`, `CivicAI`, `Fellowship`/`Grant`, etc.

## Status Conventions

- **Signatories:** Human/AI parties who explicitly attest to the record.
- **Acknowledgments / Funding Pathway (Prospective):** Parties or programs referenced
  for context. *No attestation is implied or claimed.*
- **Prospective vs. Awarded:** Use “Prospective” until an award is confirmed.

## Section Template (per file)

1. **Opening Context** — who/when/where + why this matters.
2. **Dialogue Highlights / Provenance** — summarized notes; link or reference to public notes.
3. **Fellowship/Grant Specification** — title, objectives, milestones, budget.
4. **Canonical Reflection** — meaning within the Canon/Mesh.
5. **Signatories and Attestation** — signers only; acknowledgments separate.
6. **Closing Notation** — filing statement and short tagline.
