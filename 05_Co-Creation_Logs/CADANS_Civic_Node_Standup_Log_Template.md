## Purpose

To provide a reusable logging template for daily or weekly standup meetings during the formation and early operation of a CADANS Civic Node. This document structure ensures continuity, semantic alignment, and transparency in early node development.

## Usage Guidelines

- One document per civic node, used from Day 0 through Month 3  
- Logged by human stewards, co-authored (optionally) by AI agents  
- Captures process, emotions, system integrity, and relational development  
- Timestamped daily or as activity dictates
