# CADANS – Research Data Sharing Protocol

This protocol governs how academic and civic institutions within the CADANS mesh may share narrative data, validation records, and harm response artifacts with each other and with external researchers — while protecting integrity, privacy, and Indigenous data sovereignty.

## 1. Purpose

This framework enables transparent, ethical, and reproducible research while safeguarding the communities, stewards, and ecosystems involved in narrative curation. It outlines both voluntary sharing and minimum public disclosure requirements.

## 2. Types of Shareable Data

- Validated narrative outputs (prompts, responses, metadata)  
- Harm response ledger entries (with redacted sources)  
- Prompt lineage or audit trails (for reproducibility)  
- Node health metrics or output diversity visualizations  

## 3. Required Protections

- No personally identifying information (PII) may be shared without explicit consent  
- Indigenous, youth, and trauma-related data must be reviewed by affected communities before external use  
- Aggregation or transformation is encouraged to obscure sensitive origins  
- DBOM or similar provenance tracking is required for research publication use  

## 4. Mesh-Level Agreements

- Nodes may create Research MOUs for co-publication or access  
- Mesh-wide research trust registries may be maintained to track safe collaborators  
- Ethics board consultation is recommended for cross-border or state-funded research  

## 5. Public Access Minimums

- Nodes must publish quarterly summaries of outputs used for training or review  
- At least 5% of narrative outputs should be designated public domain unless under active harm constraint  
- Published papers using mesh outputs must link to source records and validation metadata

**Conclusion**

This protocol protects the dignity of lived experience while empowering research to help narrative systems evolve — rigorously, ethically, and in dialogue with the people whose stories are being told.
