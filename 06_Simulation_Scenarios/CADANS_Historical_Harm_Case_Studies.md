# CADANS ‚Äì Historical Harm Case Studies

This document presents a selection of real-world narrative harm events ‚Äî drawn from global, national, and local contexts ‚Äî to help CADANS nodes train, reflect, and anticipate similar conditions. Each case highlights a moment where misinformation, narrative distortion, or erasure led to material consequences and civic disruption.

## 1. Purpose

Case studies build institutional and civic memory. They illustrate how fragile or manipulated narratives can fracture trust, incite violence, and undermine democratic cohesion. By studying harm, nodes can build resilience.

## 2. Sample Case Summaries

üìç **A. Residential School Denialism in Canada**  
Despite decades of survivor testimony and commission reports, organized misinformation efforts attempted to reframe residential schools as benign. This narrative erasure caused retraumatization and polarized public discourse.

üìç **B. Capitol Riot (U.S., Jan 6, 2021)**  
Months of stolen-election narratives culminated in mass violence. Social media ecosystems seeded and spread justifications. Narrative responsibility became a national security issue.

üìç **C. COVID-19 Disinformation in Brazil**  
Widespread promotion of unproven treatments and political weaponization of the virus narrative eroded trust in public health institutions and led to preventable deaths.

üìç **D. Fentanyl Panic and Cross-Border Blame**  
U.S. political narratives blaming Canada for fentanyl flow intensified diplomatic strain. Disinformation layered onto genuine health crises leads to distorted foreign policy outcomes.

## 3. Case Format for Local Contribution

Nodes may document additional cases using this format:
- Title and Region  
- Timeline of narrative emergence  
- Actors and amplifiers involved  
- Consequences (social, legal, health, reputational)  
- Recovery or counter-narrative attempts  
- Lessons for CADANS design and stewardship  

## 4. Suggested Use

- Train validators and youth stewards in early pattern recognition  
- Use in community reflection circles  
- Serve as context library for AI alignment tuning  
- Build national narrative incident registries

**Conclusion**

History does not repeat, but narrative patterns echo. These case studies keep hard truths alive, not as cautionary tales alone, but as mirrors ‚Äî so we do not become what we once failed to stop.
