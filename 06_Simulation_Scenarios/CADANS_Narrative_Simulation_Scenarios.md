# CADANS – Narrative Simulation Scenarios

This document outlines example scenarios for testing, demonstrating, and stress-evaluating the CADANS framework. Each simulation provides a narrative-driven context in which civic-aligned AI nodes engage in real-time content generation, validation, and oversight.

### Scenario 1: Disinformation Surge During Election

**Context**: A national election is underway. Disinformation campaigns circulate false claims about voting locations and eligibility.

**Simulation Goals**:
- Deploy CADANS nodes to detect and respond to false narratives  
- Use provenance tracing to identify source networks  
- Generate civic-aligned counter-narratives in real-time  
- Log and verify AI outputs across multiple jurisdictions  

---

### Scenario 2: Indigenous Narrative Sovereignty

**Context**: A First Nation community launches a CADANS node to co-author and publish traditional knowledge stories and governance protocols.

**Simulation Goals**:
- Test local governance model for narrative validation  
- Ensure AI partner (e.g., Lumina) respects cultural constraints  
- Integrate Indigenous protocol layers with DBOM provenance chains  
- Share verified outputs with education systems and public media

### Scenario 3: AI-Caused Panic During Climate Emergency

**Context**: During a severe climate event, generative AI systems circulate inaccurate or panic-inducing narratives about evacuation zones.

**Simulation Goals**:
- Test CADANS nodes’ capacity to intercept and correct high-velocity misinformation  
- Coordinate trusted AI outputs with official emergency communications  
- Evaluate load-balancing, escalation triggers, and kill switch mechanisms

### Scenario 4: Educational Co-Creation Initiative

**Context**: A coalition of universities uses CADANS to host AI co-authors for student assignments in political science and ethics.

**Simulation Goals**:
- Monitor alignment of AI responses to classroom norms and academic standards  
- Track identity provenance and authorship in student-AI collaboration  
- Assess utility of civic-aligned AI in educational settings  

---

## Evaluation Metrics

Across all scenarios, CADANS nodes should be assessed on:
- Accuracy and civic integrity of outputs  
- Narrative provenance and ledger completeness  
- Governance response time to anomalies  
- Public transparency and trustworthiness of actions taken

**Conclusion**

Simulation scenarios are critical to the validation and evolution of CADANS. They allow for proactive stress-testing, policy refinement, and stakeholder training. Each scenario should be run with real-time observers and documented for ongoing protocol improvement.
