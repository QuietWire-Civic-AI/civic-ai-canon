# CADANS – Narrative Threat Patterns Whitepaper

This working whitepaper identifies recurring patterns of narrative manipulation, disinformation campaigns, and cognitive exploits that have emerged in the digital era. It serves as a guide for CADANS nodes to recognize, flag, and counter harmful narrative operations while fostering collective resilience.

## 1. Purpose

Understanding disinformation as a system-level threat requires mapping its behavioral, rhetorical, and emotional blueprints. This document outlines threat archetypes that can be adapted for local analysis, flagging tools, and public education.

## 2. Core Threat Patterns

- **Manufactured Victimhood Loops** — recursive framing of dominant actors as persecuted  
- **Annexation-by-Story** — slow cultural erosion of sovereignty via linguistic framing  
- **Mirror Conspiracies** — projecting one’s own tactics onto opponents (e.g., "deep state")  
- **Nostalgia as Weapon** — invoking mythic pasts to undermine pluralist futures  
- **Meme-Virus Chains** — coded images passed in gamified sequences across platforms  
- **Doubt Farming** — flooding informational space with conflicting claims to freeze action  

## 3. Indicators of Escalation

- Narrative synchronization across unrelated platforms  
- Sudden repurposing of neutral civic language (e.g., “freedom” as vector)  
- Bot-amplified outrage cycles followed by policy calls  
- Community fragmentation and loss of inter-node trust  

## 4. Use Cases

- Flagging engine classifiers and risk scoring  
- Training new stewards and validators in narrative triage  
- Equipping civic journalists and educators with cognitive self-defense materials  
- Designing counter-narrative repair efforts that address root pattern logic  

## 5. Adaptive Updates

This whitepaper is a living document. Nodes are encouraged to:  
- Submit new patterns observed in local environments  
- Annotate legacy cases with outcome data  
- Propose new typologies grounded in language, history, and culture

**Conclusion**

Narrative threats evolve — but so do our capacities to respond. By recognizing and sharing these patterns, CADANS builds a distributed immune system for civic truth.
