# CADANS – Rapid Response Activation Checklist

This checklist provides guidance for node stewards to activate coordinated rapid response efforts when urgent narrative threats emerge — such as viral disinformation, cross-border media shocks, political destabilization campaigns, or public safety distortions.

## 1. Activation Triggers

- Cross-node flagging of coordinated narrative threat (H4–H5 harm)  
- Sudden volume spike of AI-generated misinformation  
- Harm to specific communities (Indigenous, youth, immigrants, LGBTQ2S+)  
- Public confusion about a critical civic or health issue  
- Media coverage misframing local actors or events  

## 2. Immediate Response Actions

☐ Confirm threat via validator consensus  
☐ Notify mesh peers of potential escalation  
☐ Deploy ethical counter-narrative message (with timestamp + source)  
☐ Initiate dialogue event or public steward note  
☐ Publish a Rapid Response Ledger entry (RRL-#)  
☐ Archive all materials under Public Memory Protocol  

## 3. Communications Considerations

- Avoid reactive tone; prioritize clarity and civic calm  
- Quote impacted communities rather than speaking over  
- Translate early and often  
- Include citations and tools for audience self-verification  
- Offer opt-in context layering (short version, deep dive, flag lineage)  

## 4. Coordination Options

- Mirror node amplification (publish same note with local lens)  
- Pair response with community listening circle  
- Signal Ethics Council if threat pattern is novel or systemic  
- Invite public annotation via civic feedback tools  

## 5. Follow-Up and Recalibration

- Publish a post-response reflection (what was missed, what worked)  
- Add insight to mesh-wide threat database  
- Thank validators, partners, and public contributors  
- Update pattern models if applicable

**Conclusion**

This checklist helps ensure that when the signal field shakes, CADANS nodes respond with agility, care, and alignment — not panic. Narrative crises are moments of choice. This tool helps make the right one, together.
