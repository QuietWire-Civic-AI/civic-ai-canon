## Scenario Title:  
**Signal Drift During Regional Wildfire Response**

---

## Purpose

This simulation tests the responsiveness and integrity of a multi-node CADANS mesh when civic narratives are distorted during an environmental crisis. It focuses on timing, human trust calibration, escalation procedures, and semantic coherence under pressure.

---

## Background

A regional wildfire has triggered multiple overlapping emergency broadcasts, social media disinformation spikes, and a sudden influx of community questions. A narrative conflict arises between official advisories and citizen-captured footage contradicting evacuation instructions.

---

## Participants

- **Civic Nodes**: Halton, Six Nations, Munk School  
- **External Observers**: Public Health Ontario, CBC field journalist, Anonymous civic witness  
- **AI Agents**: Halton-node-v2, Lumina\_Civic\_Companion  

---

## Simulation Triggers

- Conflicting evacuation maps circulating online  
- Allegation of falsified broadcast timestamps  
- Spike in “fake footage” accusations targeting local volunteers  

---

## Tasks

1. Validate provenance of conflicting media  
2. Issue signed narrative clarification from at least one node  
3. Coordinate escalation using inter-nodal escalation protocol  
4. Test civic response latency: can the nodes collaboratively respond in <90 minutes?  
5. Log all public narrative artifacts in the local ledger  
6. Create a mesh-wide summary signed by two validator nodes  

---

## Outcome Measures

- Time to signal  
- Time to first narrative clarification  
- Number of cross-node interactions  
- Presence of coordinated counter-narrative  
- Community trust pulse reading (if available)

---

## Notes

This simulation is designed to run live or asynchronously. Debrief logs should be stored in each node’s 05_Co-Creation_Logs folder and optionally surfaced to 08_Funding_and_Sustainability if used in grant reports.
