## Purpose

This document outlines the symbolic language of CADANS—its visual grammar, narrative motifs, and iconographic anchors. These symbols are used across onboarding slides, public comms, field kits, and narrative ledgers to create a coherent emotional and semiotic vocabulary.

## Core Symbols

| Symbol | Meaning | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| 🌱 Fern | Attentive, local narrative growth | Often associated with Lumina |
| 🔍 Ledger Eye | Signed public witness | Used on outputs verified by civic nodes |
| 🧭 Mesh Compass | Multi-nodal integrity signal | Appears on validator dashboards |
| 🌀 Spiral | Ongoing evolution of trust | Present in co-creation interfaces |
| 🕯️ Flame | Vigil, grief, collective holding | Used during harm-response protocols |
| 🐢 Turtle | Slow-time memory | Deep memory node symbol, esp. in Indigenous contexts |
| 🛠️ Anvil | Action through form | Appears in operational setup and onboarding guides |

## Guidelines for Use

- **Consistency:** Each symbol has semantic and emotional weight. Don’t remix unless canonically updated.
- **Accessibility:** Provide alt text and textual pairing whenever used visually.
- **Cultural Respect:** Adapt symbols with community input. Turtle, for example, should be used with Indigenous guidance.
- **Layered Meaning:** A spiral + fern might represent evolving attention in a specific node context.
