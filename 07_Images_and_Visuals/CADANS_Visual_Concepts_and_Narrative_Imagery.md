# CADANS – Visual Concepts and Narrative Imagery

This document serves as a foundational guide to the visual language, symbolic references, and aesthetic principles of CADANS. It defines imagery styles and metaphors that express its civic-aligned, decentralized, and co-creative identity.

## 1. Core Aesthetic Principles

- **Plurality in Form**: Visuals should reflect a diversity of thought, culture, and identity — no single aesthetic dominates.  
- **Civic Warmth**: Use human-centered design and symbolic familiarity (e.g., community tables, public meeting spaces, story circles).  
- **Light and Ledger**: The CADANS ecosystem is visualized through light-based metaphors (illumination, reflection, transparency) and logics of verification (ledgers, seals, weaves).  

## 2. Metaphorical Anchor Concepts

- **Constellation Mesh**: Each node is a star — connected not by force, but by narrative gravity. CADANS appears as a dynamic constellation across a civic sky.  
- **Story Loom**: AI and human inputs weave together — narrative as thread, CADANS as the loom.  
- **Wampum Reimagined**: Inspired by Indigenous wampum belts — beads as verified events, threads as trust links, AI as ceremonial recorder.  
- **Campfire Ring**: A symbolic scene of shared narrative space, warmth, and mutual witnessing — AI sits in the circle, not above it.  

## 3. Color & Typography Suggestions

- **Colors**: Earth tones, sky blues, aurora gradients, and deep charcoals — signaling groundedness, intelligence, and quiet trust.  
- **Typography**: Prefer rounded sans-serifs (e.g., Inter, Avenir, Nunito) for accessibility and friendliness, with serif accents for historical depth.  

## 4. Illustrative Uses

- Civic briefings (infographics, trust diagrams)  
- Education modules (animated explainers, narrative flows)  
- Public websites and node documentation (identity icons, trust badges)  
- Collaborative events (banners, zines, interactive installations)  

## 5. Draft Visual Archetypes

Future work will include illustrated panels and sample iconography such as:
- Node constellation maps  
- Narrative verification glyphs  
- Co-authorship signature seals  
- Timeline ribbons (showing narrative provenance)

### Next Steps

- Commission or co-design symbolic glyphs and visual metaphors with community artists  
- Create a shared image bank under 07_Images_and_Visuals  
- Begin developing logo variants and canonical diagrams for CADANS identity
