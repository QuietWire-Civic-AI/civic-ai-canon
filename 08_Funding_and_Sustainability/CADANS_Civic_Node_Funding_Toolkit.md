This toolkit provides guidance for new or existing CADANS nodes seeking sustainable funding. It includes suggested budget templates, potential sources of support, and strategic messaging for funders in government, philanthropy, and civil society.

## 1. Why Fund CADANS Nodes?

CADANS nodes serve as narrative infrastructure for civic resilience. They:  
- Enable transparent, verifiable public communication  
- Host AI co-authors with ethical safeguards  
- Support community memory and harm response  
- Provide training and tools to counter disinformation  
- Operate as decentralized, nonpartisan civic institutions

- Node Coordinator Honorarium: $18,000  
- Part-time Steward / Researcher: $12,000  
- Equipment + Hosting Costs: $4,000

- Printing, Outreach, Zines: $2,000  
**Total: $39,000 CAD**

## 4. Messaging for Funders
