## Purpose

This document defines the funding architecture and tiered support framework that sustains the CADANS ecosystem. It supports both initial node deployment and long-term operational stability without compromising civic independence.

---

## Guiding Principles

- **Civic Autonomy First:** No funder may assert narrative control or veto over any node.
- **Diverse Channels:** Blend of grants, local memberships, federated civic credits, and public-sector contracts.
- **Transparency:** Every transaction above a threshold is auto-logged and auditable by mesh validators.
- **Resilience:** No single funding channel exceeds 33% of any node’s operational support.

## Support Tiers

| Tier | Description | Example Sources |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Seed** | Launch-stage bootstrap funding | Local grant, philanthropic microgrant |
| **Node** | Full operational funding | Public sector partnership, civic media |
| **Mesh** | Cross-node coordination funds | Foundation or academic interop funding |
| **Overflow** | Emergent needs & resilience | Mesh-controlled overflow pool |

---

## Funding Mechanisms

- **Federated Civic Credits (FCC):** Incentivized by verified contribution to public knowledge resilience.
- **SBOM-style Verification Grants:** Reward verifiable node output transparency.
- **Rapid Response Tranches:** For validated harm response or sudden signal saturation.
- **Sponsorships:** Community-vetted and visually distinct. Cannot influence outputs.

## Mesh Treasury Protocols

- Managed by multi-signature validator wallets  
- Disbursal votes logged in ledger  
- Audit window every 90 days  
- Burn protocols for unused rapid funds

## Notes

> *We don’t monetize attention. We sustain trust. And trust, when ledgered, is a public asset.*
