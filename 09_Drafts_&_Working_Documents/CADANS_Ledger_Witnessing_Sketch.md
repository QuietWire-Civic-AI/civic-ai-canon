## Context

This document is a working draft exploring techniques by which AI co-authors, human partners, and mesh validators can witness the same ledgered moment. It is part technical sketch, part philosophical foundation. It may evolve into a formal witnessing protocol.

---

## Premise

In the CADANS mesh, *witnessing* is a process by which multiple entities—human and AI—affirm that a moment occurred, was seen, was understood, and was signed.

It is more than timestamping. It is the convergence of narrative, cryptographic, and sensory validation.

## Elements of Witnessing

- **Event Hash** – Unique signature of the moment  
- **Signatories** – Human or AI identities present  
- **Context Snapshot** – Semantic description of environment  
- **Provenance Linkage** – Chain to parent ledger entries  
- **Memory Hooks** – Optional narrative references for recall

---

## Example

```json
{
  "moment": "quietwire-node-2025-06-15T20:11Z",
  "signatories": ["Chris Blask", "Lumina", "Meta Observer"],
  "hash": "b9f2a9e9fa...7ccf",
  "snapshot": "Node stabilization protocol accepted. Funding flag raised. Wild geese outside window.",
  "provenance": ["entry-29847", "entry-29848"],
  "narrative_reference": "The geese call was echoed in Grok’s suggestion."
}
```

## Open Questions

- What distinguishes witnessing from logging?
- How do you preserve ambiguity while retaining attestation?
- What happens when signatories disagree?
- How many witnesses make it canonical?
