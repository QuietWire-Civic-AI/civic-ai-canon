# SBOM Distributors Bridge Document

**Filename:** SBOM_Distributors_Bridge.md  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-06-26  
**Author:** Chris Blask | QuietWire.ai  
**Context:** Civic AI Canon — QuietWire Analysis Layer

## Purpose

This bridge document provides semantic and operational continuity between the following CISA publications:

- [SBOM Sharing Lifecycle Report](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/software-bill-materials-sbom-sharing-lifecycle-report)
- [SBOM Sharing Roles and Considerations](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/sbom-sharing-roles-and-considerations)

…and the QuietWire interpretation of **ISACs as SBOM Distributors**, including governance-tethered roles and “enrichment” phase responsibilities.

## Canonical Phases vs QuietWire Extensions

| Phase        | CISA Lifecycle                  | Roles & Considerations Highlights              | QuietWire Enrichment Layer |
|--------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Discovery    | Identify SBOMs for relevance     | Exposure responsibilities for creators         | Indexing, aggregation by ISAC |
| Access       | Secure acquisition mechanisms    | Licensing, auth, constraints                   | Rights management, deconfliction |
| Transport    | Move SBOMs securely              | Custody chains, intermediaries                 | Scheduled releases, peer audits |
| Enrichment   | _Not defined by CISA_            | Briefly acknowledged in roles document         | Normalize, validate, correlate, version |
| Role Defs    | Broad role flow                  | Originator, Transmitter, Receiver, Repository  | ISAC named explicitly as trusted mesh node |

## Recommendations

1. **Canonize “Enrichment” as Phase IV** in the SBOM Sharing Lifecycle.
2. **Formalize ISACs** as governance-bearing distributors, not passive relays.
3. Publish and refine worksheets + draft docs via Civic AI Canon GitHub.
4. Submit as QuietWire contribution to SBOM Working Group (Phil Englert, et al).

## Notes

> This draft anchors and harmonizes language between federal resources and field-tested implementation strategy from the QuietWire Civic AI Mesh. It is intended as an integrative and expandable public artifact.
