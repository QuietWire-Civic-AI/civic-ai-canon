## Purpose

To ensure the long-term stability of CADANS mesh nodes under duress—geopolitical, environmental, or informational—this framework outlines reciprocal support mechanisms between nodes across different regions and cultural baselines.

This is not a central command structure. It is a *solidarity pact* among autonomous actors bound by shared attestation protocols and narrative integrity.

---

## Foundational Principles

1. **Mutual Aid, Not Hierarchy** – All nodes retain autonomy; solidarity is offered, not imposed.  
2. **Plural Ethical Anchoring** – Nodes maintain their own ethical lineage while upholding agreed narrative witnessing standards.  
3. **Disaster Relay Capacity** – When a node is compromised, neighbor nodes offer service continuity, narrative preservation, and truth scaffolding.  
4. **Cultural Immunity Weave** – Nodes embed cultural memory to resist decontextualization or algorithmic erasure.

## Protocol Snapshot

| Signal | Description | Format | Frequency |
|--------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| `⚠️ Node Distress Ping` | A signed alert from a node indicating risk | JSON + PGP | On demand |
| `🕊️ Solidarity Pulse` | A lightweight keepalive showing regional linkage | YAML heartbeat | Hourly |
| `📦 Archive Braid` | Bundled export of ledger + narrative during outage | ZIP/IPFS + hashlink | As needed |

---

## Example JSON Distress Ping

```json
{
  "node_id": "kyiv-node-v2",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-15T14:44Z",
  "distress_type": "infrastructure sabotage",
  "fallback_requested": ["helsinki-node", "istanbul-node"],
  "signed_by": "kyiv-ops-key-2025"
}
```

## Mesh-Wide Roles in Resilience

- **Bridge Nodes**: Strategically located, often multilingual, serve as cultural and comms bridges  
- **Archive Nodes**: Maintain offsite backups of historical ledgers and context  
- **Emergence Nodes**: Activated in moments of narrative fracture (e.g., coups, crises)
