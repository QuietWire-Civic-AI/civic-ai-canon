# CADANS – International Mesh Alignment Protocol

As CADANS expands globally, this protocol defines how independent nodes across countries can federate ethically, validate each other’s narrative outputs, and preserve civic trust without centralized control.

## 1. Purpose of the Protocol

To establish mutual visibility, validator cooperation, and narrative consistency between international CADANS-aligned nodes. This allows a distributed mesh of civic-led systems to share outputs, flag risks, and align on harm responses — without enforcing uniformity or hierarchy.

## 2. Node Roles in the Global Mesh

- **Observer Node** – receives outputs and publishes local commentary, no outbound trust assertions  
- **Peer Node** – mutually validates another node’s alignment and output integrity  
- **Validator Node** – runs integrity, sentiment, and cultural checks on third-party outputs  
- **Steward Node** – makes binding ethical decisions for its domain and contributes to transnational forums  

## 3. Trust Handshake Protocol

1. Node requests visibility into another node’s output ledger or summary digest  
2. Nodes exchange public keys, alignment compacts, and validator policies  
3. Shared validation token is created, signed, and timestamped (`mesh_token.sig`)  
4. Nodes optionally establish a co-validation loop with asynchronous flagging  

## 4. Alignment Framework Interoperability

- Each node publishes a summary of its alignment fingerprint (values, exclusions, ethics base)  
- Nodes recognize differences but agree to declare points of divergence  
- Global mesh-wide harm categories include:  
  - Disinfo escalation (cross-node manipulation)  
  - Cultural trauma triggers  
  - Cross-border law enforcement implications  
  - Synthetic identity weaponization  

## 5. Mesh Federation & Conflict Handling

If two nodes disagree on narrative output integrity:  
- They enter a lightweight dispute resolution flow (dialogue log + comment replay)  
- Community observers or third-party validators may issue reviews  
- Final annotations are attached to original ledger entries (but not censored or overwritten)  

## 6. Technical Payload Format

- Signed output blob (`output_xxx.json`) includes:  
  - prompt  
  - AI response  
  - model ID  
  - alignment version  
  - validator notes  
  - stewardship tags  
- `mesh_review.yaml` carries:  
  - validation source  
  - degree of divergence  
  - advisory (align, caution, dispute)  

## 7. Transparency and Publication

All global mesh events — co-validation, disputes, convergences — are recorded in public logs, signed by stewards, and available to local communities.  
This ensures the mesh remains accountable to people, not platforms.

**Conclusion**

This protocol allows global collaboration on narrative integrity without collapsing into centralized control. The mesh breathes — federated, ethical, and visible — because stewards everywhere commit to being seen.
