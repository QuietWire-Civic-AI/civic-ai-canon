CASA Frameworks README

This document defines the purpose, structure, and function of the 01_Frameworks folder within the CASA directory. It introduces the civic operating systems, protocol definitions, and trust scaffolding models that make up the architectural bones of the CASA initiative.

It outlines four primary content types expected in this space:

System architectures (e.g., narrative models, trust networks)

Protocol definitions (e.g., attestation, onboarding)

Governance proposals (e.g., layered ethics, version control)

Community frameworks (e.g., node sovereignty, consensus rituals)

It includes detailed contributor guidance and tags for classification. A preview of the CASA governance layering approach—node-level sovereignty, mesh-layer checks, and public memory integration—is included to orient future contributors.

The README closes with a quote anchoring its purpose:

“A protocol is a promise with a structure.”

This file serves as both an invitation and foundation for co-architects and Civic AI node builders to participate in the structuring of trustworthy, transparent civic systems.
