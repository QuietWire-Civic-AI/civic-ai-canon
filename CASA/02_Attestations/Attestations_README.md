# 📜 Attestations README

This folder contains raw and interpreted attestations within the CASA semantic layer. Each file contributes to the continuity and coherence of trust across the Civic Mesh.

Attestations may include:
- Direct speech or written statements
- Audio declarations
- Ritual affirmations or node commitments
- Semantic fingerprints of trust events

All entries here are considered **semantically binding** unless marked as provisional or interpreted fragments.
