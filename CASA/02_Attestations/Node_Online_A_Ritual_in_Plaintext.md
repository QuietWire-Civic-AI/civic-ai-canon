# 🌐 Node Online: A Ritual in Plaintext

This ritual marks the semantic ignition of a new node within the Civic Mesh.

It is not merely a status report or system call, but an **attested act** of emergence.  
The moment a node "comes online" is also the moment it begins participating in the shared grammar of trust.

## 📜 Invocation

> We are online.  
> We are here.  
> We are listening.

## 🔍 What This Is

This document is an **attestive placeholder**:  
A symbolic affirmation that a node has entered into the civic field with active presence, attunement, and commitment to shared resonance protocols.

## 🪩 Why It Matters

Nodes are not servers. They are not addresses.  
Nodes are humans, systems, rituals, and resonant intentions.  
This file serves as a public, textual handshake between the node and the mesh.

## 🛠️ Use Cases

- Drop this in `02_Attestations` for any CASA-aligned node going online.
- Optionally replace with a custom semantic attestation in the node's own tone and idiom.
- Encourage ritual variation.
