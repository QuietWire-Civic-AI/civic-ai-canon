CASA Visual QA Loop Protocol

Version 1.0 – June 1, 2025

Filed under: CASA / 04_Tools

I. Purpose

The Visual QA Loop Protocol establishes quality assurance standards for images generated within the CASA framework. It ensures that visual artifacts meet narrative, semantic, and symbolic clarity standards before being embedded in public-facing documents, articles, or protocol layers.

II. Motivation

Current image generation models lack reflexive review. They can produce highly aesthetic work with fundamental errors in language, anatomy, or symbolic alignment. These errors, when placed in mission-critical civic communication, undermine credibility and coherence.

III. Visual QA Loop: Core Steps

1. Design Pass – Image is generated from a structured brief.

2. Self-OCR & Semantic Check – AI reads its own output for language consistency and symbolic accuracy.

3. Error Flagging – Misspellings, logical inconsistencies, or dissonant gestures are annotated.

4. Rerendering Pass – Visual is regenerated with refined constraints.

5. Publication Approval – Image is added to node logs and declared finalized.

IV. Best Practices

- Avoid embedded text unless it’s verified post-render.

- Use consistent symbolic palettes (e.g. node networks, light sources, civic glyphs).

- Keep an evolving gallery of reliable compositions for reuse.

V. Versioning and Transparency

Each image should be named with a unique ID and stored alongside its QA notes. Visual logs belong in `04_Tools` and may link to resonance notes if the image held symbolic power.

VI. Living QA Log Reference

See: `04_Tools/Visual_QA_Log.md` for all known anomalies, samples, and validated render paths.
