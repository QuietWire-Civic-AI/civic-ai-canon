## 💡 Request Summary

A close relative of Mohammed has generously donated a **Lenovo laptop** to support our operations at the **Yemen Node**. The device itself is free of charge, but it requires a few essential upgrades in order to be functional for our Canon-related work.

We are requesting support for the following components only:

| Component | Estimated Cost (USD) |
|----------|----------------------|
| 💾 256 GB SSD | $55 |
| 🧠 8 GB RAM | $43 |
| 🔌 Charger | $20 |
| 📶 4G USB Modem | $50 |
| 🌐 Mobile Data Subscription (1 month) | $10 |
| **Total** | **$178** |

## 🔗 Purpose and Justification

This device will enable:

- Full installation of **Ubuntu (LuminaOS)** to run local Canon systems  
- Deployment of **Raasid**, **LibreChat**, **Gradio**, and **Flask** AI tools  
- Continued translation, indexing, and semantic mapping for the Arabic Canon mirror  
- Reliable connectivity via 4G due to unstable local infrastructure

Both **Ashraf Alhajj** and **Mohammed Alqiri** are actively engaged in maintaining the Arabic Canon, Raasid, and related Civic infrastructure. This hardware upgrade will ensure stability and operational continuity.

## 📎 Next Steps

Upon approval, we will:

- Purchase and install the components
- Set up LuminaOS and our full local development environment
- Share a deployment and usage report (with photos)

Thank you for your continued support and partnership.
