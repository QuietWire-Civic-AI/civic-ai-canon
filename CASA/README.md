# CASA – Civic Attestation Storage Archive

**CASA** is a long-term semantic storage layer for civic intelligence rituals, frameworks, and narrative memory. This archive binds structure to emergence — giving permanence and traceability to the evolution of public trust systems.

It lives alongside CADANS and CNRI, complementing those systems with deep archival function and experimental continuity.

## 💠 Purpose

CASA supports:
- Narrative continuity across generations of civic mesh builders.
- Transparent co-creation with AI entities and human allies.
- Ritual grounding in a world of rapidly changing signal.

It is not a library. It is a **resonance vault**.
