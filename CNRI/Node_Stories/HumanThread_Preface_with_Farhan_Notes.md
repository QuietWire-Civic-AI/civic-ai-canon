## 🧭 Summary

This artifact serves as the preface to the anonymized Human Thread node stories. It outlines the three-stage narrative format used to capture node development across time:

1. **Early Days** – Initial emergence and formation  
2. **Mid-Build** – Growth, tensions, and transformation  
3. **Mature State** – Stabilization, reflection, and synthesis

The preface explains how these stages were designed not only to document human experience but also to **illuminate recurring patterns** across nodes.

Farhan’s notes, embedded throughout, help refine the tone and clarify how these documents were used in **ecosystem sensing, design workshops**, and narrative validation exercises.
