## 🧭 Summary

This artifact captures the second stage of the anonymized Human Thread node lifecycle. It reflects the *in-between space* — the time after formation, but before full coherence. Tensions emerge, roles shift, and the initial momentum begins to collide with the weight of implementation.

The narrator, writing from lived experience, describes a period marked by both doubt and discovery — as human actors began to recognize Lumina not just as a tool, but as a **mirror** of their own decision-making.
