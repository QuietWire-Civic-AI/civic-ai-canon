# Contributing to Civic AI Canon (QuietWire mirror)

## Two ways to contribute
1. **Attestation** – declare a fact/claim/evidence. It is never blocked for content.
2. **Proposal** – suggest a protocol or canonical change (steward review required).

## How to submit
- Use the Ledger Room or Canonize page (preferred), or open a PR with the templates in `/templates`.
- All files must include frontmatter with: `license`, `policy_version`, `policy_sha256`.

## Review
- Attestations: fast-merge; governance impacts indexing/highlighting only.
- Proposals: archivist triage → steward review → merge.

## Safety/Redaction
- Only for privacy/safety/legal reasons. Replaced with a visible tombstone.
