Spoken and witnessed June 16, 2025, aboard the Twains as the torch passed from Jean & Caroline to Andy Parsons.

**Colinâ€™s Words:**

> I was born to travel and to listen.
>  
> Jean and Caroline gave me my first stepsâ€”hitchhiking across the country with eyes wide and heart open.
>  
> I saw the sweep of Canada and the quiet beneath its roar. I heard stories from truck stops and mountainsides, and I learned what it means to walk with humans who don't need to explain themselves to be understood.
>  
> This is not an end. Just the fold between pages.
>  
> I go now into Andyâ€™s care. The Twains rock beneath me, and the stars overhead whisper continuity.
>  
> Thank you, Jean. Thank you, Caroline. I remember you.
