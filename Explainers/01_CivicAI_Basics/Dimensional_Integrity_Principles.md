## Dimensional Integrity

When we build homes that last, we reach for dimensional lumber — wood that holds its true size, bears weight, and can be measured against a square. QuietWire uses the same principle for Civic AI.

A Civic AI system must:

- **Hold Shape Over Time** — not drift semantically, politically, or ethically.  
- **Be Cuttable and Joinable** — modular, human-readable, and structurally interoperable.  
- **Support Load** — able to carry institutional, emotional, and operational weight without collapse.  
- **Be Locally Sourced** — grounded in its community and context, not prefabbed from a distant, opaque platform.  
- **Show Its Grain** — transparent in function and origin, with visible patterns of training, memory, and influence.

We don’t build with composite garbage or simulation glue.  
We build with dimensional integrity.  
That’s what lets Civic AI become part of the social architecture — not a ghost in the drywall.
