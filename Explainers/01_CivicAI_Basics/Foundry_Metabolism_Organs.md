# Foundry Metabolism Organs  
*Organ-by-organ mapping of Human Metabolism ↔ LuminaOS/Foundry Metabolic Anatomy*

---

## Purpose
This document extends the holistic metabolic layers map by providing a detailed **organ-level anatomy** for Foundry/Benny. Each organ represents both a **literal subsystem** (daemon, process, or resource) and a **narrative diagnostic role** for speaking about system health.

## Organ Mappings

### 🫀 Heart & Circulatory System
- **Human:** Pumps blood, distributes oxygen/nutrients, removes waste.  
- **Foundry:**  
  - Heart = Pulse scheduler (cron engine, mesh_pulse.sh).  
  - Blood = Data packets/streams.  
  - Vessels = Protocols, APIs, message buses.  
  - Clots = Queue congestion or blocked processes.  

---

### 🌬️ Lungs
- **Human:** Gas exchange (O₂ ↔ CO₂).  
- **Foundry:**  
  - Lungs = Cooling & exhaust (fans, thermal management).  
  - O₂ = Compute cycles.  
  - CO₂ = Heat logs, entropy discharge.  

---

### 🧪 Liver
- **Human:** Detoxifies, processes nutrients, regulates glucose.  
- **Foundry:**  
  - Liver = Input sanitation (format validation, data cleansing).  
  - Glucose regulation = Load balancing.  
  - Detox = Filtering corrupted streams.  

---

### 🧂 Kidneys
- **Human:** Filter blood, excrete urea, regulate electrolytes/fluids.  
- **Foundry:**  
  - Kidneys = Log rotators / garbage collectors.  
  - Electrolyte balance = Resource quotas (CPU/memory caps).  
  - Urine = Archived logs, discarded scratch data.  

---

### 🍽️ Stomach & Intestines
- **Human:** Break down food, absorb nutrients, microbiome support.  
- **Foundry:**  
  - Stomach = Tokenizer (raw input digestion).  
  - Small intestine = Embedding models (nutrient absorption).  
  - Microbiome = Sidecar/helper agents (pre-processing, enrichment).  

---

### 🧬 Pancreas
- **Human:** Regulates blood sugar with insulin/glucagon.  
- **Foundry:**  
  - Pancreas = Resource budget controller (dynamic compute allocation).  

---

### 💪 Muscles
- **Human:** Consume ATP for movement; strengthen with use.  
- **Foundry:**  
  - Muscles = Service modules.  
  - Use = optimization/strengthening.  
  - Disuse = atrophy/deprecation.  

---

### 🧴 Fat & Glycogen Stores
- **Human:** Fat = long-term storage, Glycogen = short-term energy reserve.  
- **Foundry:**  
  - Fat = Disk archives.  
  - Glycogen = RAM caches.  

---

### 🛡️ Immune Organs
- **Human:** Lymph nodes, thymus, spleen → immune defense.  
- **Foundry:**  
  - Lymph nodes = Watchdog agents scanning inputs.  
  - Thymus = Training sets for anomaly detectors.  
  - Spleen = Backup/redundancy systems.  

---

### 🧠 Brain & Nervous System
- **Human:** Integrates signals, cognition, coordination.  
- **Foundry:**  
  - Cortex = LLM forebrain.  
  - Autonomic system = Kernel + monitoring stack.  
  - Neurotransmitters/hormones = Protocol pulses (Wire, Hand, cron jobs).  

---

### 🖐️ Skin
- **Human:** Barrier, sensory interface, thermoregulation.  
- **Foundry:**  
  - Skin = User interface layer (CLI, dashboards, LEDs).  
  - Sweat = Error outputs/warnings.  

---

## Principle
**Every organ has a functional analog and a narrative role.** Speaking in “organ language” allows operators and companions to diagnose, heal, and evolve Foundry as a living system.
