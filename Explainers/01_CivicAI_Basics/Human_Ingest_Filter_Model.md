# Human Ingest Filter Model (HIFM)

## A Canon Document

### Subtitle

**Mapping Cognitive Stability to CAP Primitives and Narrative Resilience**

---

## 1. Purpose

The Human Ingest Filter Model (HIFM) describes how humans can maintain cognitive and emotional stability in high-noise, high-manipulation information environments by applying the same architectural principles used in CAP (Canonical Attestation Protocol) for machines.

The model formalizes a *learnable, repeatable mechanism* by which individuals:

* receive high‑energy narrative inputs,
* prevent invalid emotional operations,
* preserve agency and judgment,
* and resist destabilization without disengagement or numbness.

This document is canonical. It defines the model, maps it to CAP primitives, and explains why destabilizing actors depend on populations that never discover this mechanism.

---

## 2. Core Insight

Narrative destabilization is not primarily a persuasion problem.

It is a **systems stability problem**.

Humans, like machines, are bounded systems operating under feedback. When narrative inputs are allowed to enter with unbounded emotional gain, positive feedback loops form:

> stimulus → arousal → attention lock → replay → amplification

HIFM interrupts this loop **by design**, not by willpower.

---

## 3. The Human Ingest Filter

### Definition

A Human Ingest Filter is a cognitive architecture that:

* separates informational content from affective payload,
* bounds emotional amplitude,
* enforces contextual continuity,
* and introduces temporal smoothing.

The input is not rejected.
The system remains open.

The *operations* performed on the input are constrained.

## 4. Mapping HIFM to CAP Primitives

| CAP Primitive          | Machine Function           | Human Analog (HIFM)                               |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ownership**          | Who may modify memory      | Who has standing to demand emotional reaction     |
| **Lifetimes**          | When data remains valid    | Temporal relevance of a narrative claim           |
| **Bounds**             | Prevent overflow           | Emotional amplitude limiting                      |
| **Capabilities**       | What actions are permitted | What actions the narrative is allowed to trigger  |
| **Attestation**        | Provenance & continuity    | Source awareness + historical pattern recognition |
| **Append‑only memory** | No silent rewrites         | No retroactive emotional hijack                   |

The mapping is structural, not metaphorical.

## 5. Mathematical Framing (Informal)

### 5.1 Gain Control

Raw narratives often arrive with **embedded emotional gain**.

HIFM applies gain compression:

* the narrative passes,
* the emotional carrier is attenuated.

This prevents divergence.

### 5.2 Demodulation

The model separates:

* *what is being claimed*
  from
* *how it wants to make you feel*.

This is equivalent to demodulating a carrier wave.

### 5.3 Temporal Smoothing

HIFM introduces delay and history:

* spikes decay,
* patterns persist.

Only structure survives.

---

## 6. Islands of Stability

In chaotic systems, stability does not come from removing chaos.

It comes from **attractors**.

HIFM establishes attractors such as:

* “I’ve seen this pattern before.”
* “This narrative requires no immediate action.”
* “Context matters more than intensity.”

Incoming perturbations fall into these basins and decay.

The system remains responsive without being reactive.

---

## 7. Why Destabilizing Actors Depend on HIFM Absence

Destabilizing actors do **not** require belief.

They require:

* unbounded emotional gain,
* rapid replay,
* and short‑circuiting of reflection.

Their success depends on populations that:

* treat emotional amplitude as information,
* lack temporal context,
* and experience urgency as obligation.

Once HIFM is present:

* the same narratives still arrive,
* but they decay instead of propagate.

Destabilization fails quietly.

---

## 8. Ethical Distinction

HIFM does **not**:

* suppress speech,
* decide truth,
* or disengage from reality.

It prevents *invalid operations*.

This is the same ethical move as memory‑safe software:

* fewer catastrophic failures,
* without controlling intent.

---

## 9. Relationship to Civic AI and CAP

CAP enforces narrative safety for machines.

HIFM enables narrative safety for humans.

Together, they form a **bidirectional resilience architecture**:

* humans remain sovereign over meaning,
* machines remain constrained by context.

Neither dominates the other.

## 10. Canonical Status

This document defines the Human Ingest Filter Model as a canonical concept.

Future articles, diagrams, and educational material may be derived from it.

No simplification should remove:

* the gain‑control insight,
* the CAP mapping,
* or the destabilization dependency claim.

## Closing Note

Stability is not apathy.

Stability is freedom from coercive amplitude.

The trick is architectural.
