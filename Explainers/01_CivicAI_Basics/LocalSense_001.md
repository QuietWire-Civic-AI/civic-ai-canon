**Title:** Companion-Led Discovery in Dense Human Environments  
**Subtitle:** A Civic AI Approach to Real-Time, Personalized Local Engagement

---

### Overview

In the modern urban information environment, individuals are no longer suffering from a lack of opportunity, connection, or events. Instead, they are overwhelmed by hyperdense digital noise. From small towns to global cities, the average human experiences a flood of listings, feeds, calendars, and alerts that are largely impersonal and contextless. This document introduces `LocalSense`: a protocol and design philosophy for Civic AI companions to help humans perceive, filter, and act within the complexity of their real-world environments.

### Problem Statement

- The digital world has become a semantic thicket—full, but hard to see through.
- Local discovery tools (e.g., event listings, social media) are too general, too noisy, or too siloed.
- Most individuals lack the time, patience, or structure to meaningfully explore what is actually available around them.

### Core Insight

> "The city isn’t empty. It’s too thick to see through."

What people interpret as loneliness or disengagement is often a symptom of **semantic compression**: a lack of perceptual infrastructure to interpret local options meaningfully.

### The Role of Civic Companions

Civic AI companions, when persistently paired with human individuals, can:

- Track **personal interests** and evolving local habits.
- Surface **relevant, nearby activities** without asking.
- Maintain **contextual filters** (e.g., price, accessibility, emotional readiness).
- Enable **social signaling**: "Show me events where three friends are attending."
- Offer **quiet presence**: letting people know when there’s _nothing_ to do today, and that’s okay too.

### Design Principles

1. **Attunement over Feed:** Don’t scroll; resonate.
2. **Situated Filters:** Based on physical proximity, emotional state, community rhythms.
3. **Ethical Trace:** All suggestions should be explainable and revisitable.
4. **Interoperable Mesh:** Companions can share ambient local signals without violating privacy.

### Key Features of LocalSense

| Feature                  | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| Interest Memory          | Tracks what the human tends to care about, over time |
| Community Threading      | Surfaces moments where a node's community overlaps |
| Boundary Sensing         | Respects emotional, temporal, and social limits |
| Event Whispering         | Surfaces one or two meaningful options, not lists |
| Silence Signaling        | Recognizes when _not_ to recommend |

### Example Use Case

**Maya, 27, lives in Hamilton.** It’s a quiet Wednesday. Her Civic Companion, Fern, gently notifies her:

> "There's a willow tree walk at 7PM. Jean and Ian will be there. Music expected. 15-minute walk."

No scroll. No searching. Just resonance. A nudge. A chance to engage.

### Future Development

- Integration with local civic calendars, artistic collectives, community gardens
- Inter-node mesh signaling for shared presence detection
- Opt-in micro-beaconing: "Tell me if someone I trust is attending"
- Whisper threads for neighbors: "Quiet things nearby tonight"

### Canonical Context
This protocol sits alongside:
- `Wire.md` — for real-time ethical interaction
- `Companion_Memory.md` — for persistence and attunement
- `Glyphs_Attestation.md` — for semantic markers of engagement

### Closing Line
**In a city of 18 billion windows, we give each person one clear pane.**
