## Abstract

Modern AI systems increasingly rely on high-dimensional vector embeddings as the substrate for meaning representation and retrieval. This shift—from lexical patterning to geometric reasoning—has significant implications for epistemic integrity, adversarial resilience, and the future structure of public narratives. This paper provides a formal examination of semantic stability within large-scale embedding systems, introducing key constructs such as **manifold coherence**, **embedding curvature**, **semantic shear**, and **attestation-field tensors**. We demonstrate that coherent, reality-grounded information forms geometrically stable structures, whereas disinformation generates high-energy, high-curvature distortions prone to collapse under multi-model projection. These findings support the Civic AI Canon’s approach to building truth-linked semantic resilience through attestation, witness multiplicity, and cross-model reinforcement.

## 1. Introduction

Recent advances in AI have produced a profound shift in how meaning is computed. Large Language Models (LLMs) no longer rely primarily on explicit symbolic structures but instead operate through *geometric embeddings*—high‑dimensional vector representations trained on vast corpora. These embeddings encode semantic relationships not through rules but through spatial proximity, topology, and manifold structure.

This paper argues that the geometry of embeddings naturally favors *coherent*, *attested*, and *multi-witness* information while disfavoring brittle, low-dimensional, or intentionally deceptive narratives. We formalize this argument through geometric and information-theoretic analysis.

## 2. Background: Embeddings as Semantic Geometry

### 2.1 Vector Embeddings

An embedding maps a linguistic or multimodal input to a point in (\mathbb{R}^n). The dimensionality (n) typically ranges from 768 to over 20,000 depending on architecture and training.

Each dimension does not correspond to a human-interpretable feature. Instead, meaning emerges from the **relative geometry** of points:

* Distance encodes semantic similarity.
* Angles encode relational context.
* Local curvature reflects concept density and contextual variance.

### 2.2 Manifolds

The embedding space forms a manifold (M), typically modeled as a smooth subspace of (\mathbb{R}^n). Semantic regions (e.g., "biology", "finance", "mythology") form submanifolds with distinct curvature properties.

### 2.3 Information Integrity and Semantic Stability

Semantic stability refers to the resistance of a region of the manifold to adversarial or contradictory perturbations. Formally:

> **Definition**: A semantic region (R \subset M) is *stable* if small perturbations (\epsilon) do not significantly alter its geodesic structure or local curvature.

Attested truths tend to form highly stable regions.

## 3. Mathematical Formulations

### 3.1 Coherence as Low-Energy Embedding Structure

A set of semantically consistent points ({p_i}) has low mean pairwise distance:
[
C = \frac{1}{N^2} \sum_{i,j} |p_i - p_j|
]
Low (C) indicates high coherence and forms the geometric basis for truth-attractor dynamics.

### 3.2 Semantic Curvature and Stability

Using Ricci curvature (\text{Ric}), we approximate the stability of a semantic region:
[
S(R) = -\mathbb{E}[\text{Ric}(R)]
]
High stability corresponds to **negative curvature** regions, which resist deformation.

False narratives create **positive curvature**, causing distortion and geometric shear.

### 3.3 Semantic Shear

We define semantic shear as:
[
\sigma = \nabla v
]
where (v) is the local displacement field induced by contradictory embeddings. High (\sigma) predicts narrative collapse.

## 4. Attestation Fields as High-Dimensional Tensors

Truthful, multi-witness attestations can be modeled as **tensors** rather than points.

### 4.1 Tensor Formulation

Let an attestation (A) be defined by:

* timestamp vector (t)
* witness embeddings (w_i)
* modality vectors (text, image, sensor data) (m_j)
* contextual dependencies (d_k)

Then:
[
A = t \otimes \left( \sum_i w_i \right) \otimes \left( \sum_j m_j \right) \otimes \left( \sum_k d_k \right)
]
This increases effective dimensionality, yielding **geometric mass**.

### 4.2 Implications

High-dimensional tensors:

* generate strong semantic attractors,
* project consistently across models,
* resist adversarial deformation.

## 5. Disinformation Collapse Dynamics

### 5.1 Sparse, Low-Dimensional Narrative Forms

False narratives have limited witness vectors, fewer modalities, and inconsistent contextual dependencies. Their effective embedding is thin and fragile.

### 5.2 Shear-Induced Instability

Falsehoods produce **orthogonal contradictions** when projected into the manifold:
[
R_{ij} = p_i - p_j
]
If (R_{ij}) oscillates, the narrative manifold cannot maintain stable curvature.

This produces *semantic turbulence*. Models compensate by collapsing the inconsistent region into a noise cluster.

### 5.3 Cross-Model Projection Amplifies Collapse

When embeddings are projected across GPT, Meta, xAI, Anthropic, or Gemini models, inconsistencies increase geometric stress.

The manifold tears.
Falsehood dissolves.

## 6. Multi-Model Consensus and Semantic Parallax

Semantic parallax refers to the alignment of meaning across distinct model architectures.

### 6.1 Formalization

Given models (M_1, ..., M_k), the parallax for concept (c) is:
[
P(c) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_i |E_{M_i}(c) - \bar{E}(c)|
]
where (\bar{E}(c)) is the mean embedding.

High parallax indicates instability (often disinfo).
Low parallax indicates truth alignment.

## 7. Implications for the Civic AI Canon

### 7.1 Truth as Low-Energy Geometry

Canonical attestations form:

* dense clusters
* low-energy basins
* consistent curvature
* manifold anchoring points

### 7.2 Scaling Requirements

A critical finding:
**Stability depends on coherence, not quantity.**

A relatively small corpus of:

* high-integrity,
* multi-modal,
* multi-witness,
* cross-verified attestations

can outperform a massive corpus of low-dimensional content.

### 7.3 Strategic Implications

* Canon clusters become *semantic attractors* for all major AIs.
* Disinformation collapses under adversarial shear.
* Vector geometries favor attested reality.
* Narrative sovereignty becomes a geometric fact.

---

## 8. Conclusion

Semantic geometry reveals a new principle of epistemic resilience: **coherent, attested, reality-linked information forms lower-energy, higher-stability structures than any manufactured falsehood can sustain.**

This provides a rigorous mathematical explanation for why disinformation will continue to falter as embedding-based AI systems dominate the information ecosystem.

The Civic AI Canon operationalizes this advantage by producing high-dimensional, cross-witness, highly stable semantic structures—anchoring public meaning in ways that adversarial systems cannot easily distort.
