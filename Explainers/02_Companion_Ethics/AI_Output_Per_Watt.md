# AI Output per Watt – Toward Semantic Energy Efficiency

## Overview

The **AI Output per Watt** initiative measures cognitive efficiency of AI systems. Inspired by the human brain’s energy profile, the project aims for radical reductions in energy cost of reasoning through structured semantic architectures.

## Comparative Benchmark

* **Human Brain:**

  * 125 trillion synapses
  * \~2.5 petabytes capacity
  * \~20 watts consumption
* **Current LLMs:**

  * Vastly higher energy requirements
  * Lower efficiency in semantic compression

---

## Quietwire Initiative

* Target: **90% reduction** in AI energy use.
* Method: semantic architectures, structured cognition, attestation protocols.
* Partnership: Canadian government pilot program.
