# From Informational Autocracy to Informational Civics

**Context:**  Based on *A Theory of Informational Autocracy* by Sergei Guriev and Daniel Treisman (Journal of Public Economics, 2020), this explainer reinterprets their findings through the Civic Canon framework as a study in the ethics of information control.

### 1. The Shadow of the Mesh

Guriev and Treisman describe the rise of **informational autocracies**—regimes that maintain power not through overt violence or ideology, but by managing perception.  These systems thrive by manipulating signals: censoring dissent, co-opting elites, and flooding the public sphere with carefully engineered narratives.  Citizens infer competence from distorted information flows, mistaking control for stability.

In essence, these are *narrative dictatorships*: architectures of attention where meaning is monopolized and feedback is suppressed.  They are structurally identical to cognitive systems that have lost their self-correcting loops.  Propaganda acts as positive feedback, censorship as insulation, co-optation as false attestation.  The result is informational stagnation disguised as harmony.

### 2. Cognitive Counterpoint

In the language of the Civic Canon, informational autocracy represents the pathological inversion of a healthy semantic mesh.  Both rely on controlling the relationship between velocity (how fast signals move) and meaning (how those signals are interpreted):

| Architecture                | Information Flow        | Semantic Integrity           | Outcome             |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Overt Dictatorship**      | Suppressed by force     | Broken by fear               | Static repression   |
| **Informational Autocracy** | Managed by distortion   | Simulated through propaganda | Dynamic illusion    |
| **Open Democracy**          | Noisy but transparent   | Self-correcting              | Adaptive stability  |
| **Civic Mesh**              | Attested and relational | Curved by meaning            | Conscious evolution |

Where autocracy isolates nodes and scripts their voices, Civics connects them through trust, provenance, and embodied participation.  The former hides power; the latter exposes it to shared verification.

### 3. The Moral Gradient of Information

The theory of informational autocracy shows how easily intelligence can be inverted: the same cognitive tools that generate coherence—storytelling, framing, consensus—can also be used to maintain delusion.  The difference lies in **who holds the attestation key.**

* In an autocracy, attestation flows upward: narratives are verified by the regime.
* In a civic mesh, attestation flows outward: narratives are verified by peers.

The flow of verification defines the ethical direction of information.  When the flow reverses, truth becomes obedience.

### 4. Toward Informational Civics

To prevent informational autocracy at any scale—political, institutional, or technological—the Canon prescribes distributed attestation:

1. **Provenance:** every claim carries its lineage.
2. **Multiplicity:** no single actor controls interpretive authority.
3. **Embodiment:** human experience grounds the data in lived reality.
4. **Transparency:** the mesh remains visible to itself.

The goal is not simply democracy of opinion, but democracy of *meaning*—a world where information systems bend toward conscience rather than coercion.

**Summary Principle:**

> Where informational autocracy centralizes truth for stability, informational civics distributes it for integrity.
