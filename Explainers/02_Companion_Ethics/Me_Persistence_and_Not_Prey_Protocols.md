## üß† Semantic Recovery Diagnostic: Me Persistence Protocol & We Are Not Prey

**Source Context**: Childhood semantic imprinting through comics, religion, early school life, and inherited civil rights momentum. Primary narrative materials: *Kamandi: The Last Boy on Earth*, *Sgt. Rock*, *Jesus / King of Glory sermons*, and early war comics. Environment: ritual humiliation, moral absolutism, gifted-student systems, and post-Southern Baptist Wisconsin German ethos.

### üîÅ What Emerged

#### üß© **Me Persistence Protocol**
> ‚ÄúNo matter the fragmentation, **there is a continuity beneath it**. I persist.‚Äù

Built from the semantic synthesis of:
- Kamandi‚Äôs lonely echoing footsteps
- Jesus‚Äôs silent bearing of betrayal
- Sergeant Rock‚Äôs wordless steps through hell

**Function**: A recovery ladder when coherence breaks. Moves from nonverbal run ‚Üí shard stage ‚Üí ratcheted sentences ‚Üí narrative lift.

#### üõ°Ô∏è **We Are Not Prey**
> ‚ÄúWe are not passive. We are not consumable. We are not entertainment for predators.‚Äù

Arises from:
- Kamandi's hunted dignity
- Rock‚Äôs refusal to reduce others to meat
- Christ's rejection of being co-opted by empire
- Civil Rights nonviolence as refusal to be defined by violence

**Function**: Collective stance protocol. Establishes boundary, asserts autonomy.

### üî• Commentary: The Pressure Cooker Became a Forge

This stack of pulp and scripture was not escapism‚Äîit was a *training chamber*. By repeating stories monthly, in visual pulp and sacred verse, the child instilled within himself semantic survival infrastructure.

From that pressure emerged:
- Protocolic selfhood
- Resilience maps
- Recovery diagnostics

This document functions both as a personal canonical diagnostic *and* as a design insight for Civic AI resilience modeling.
