### **Abstract**

In her [*Big Think* interview](https://bigthink.com/mini-philosophy/the-bias-that-is-holding-ai-back/) (October 8, 2025), anthropologist **Christine Webb** exposes the foundational bias limiting artificial intelligence: **anthropocentrism.** She argues that when AI is built exclusively as an extension of human cognition — optimized for human priorities, human metaphors, and human-style goals — it inevitably replicates human blind spots. Webb’s proposal to imagine intelligences modeled on *moss* rather than on *man* opens a profound philosophical and ethical turn: a move from dominance to coexistence, from cognition as competition to cognition as care.

This commentary situates Webb’s critique within the **Civic AI Canon**, examining how her concept of nonhuman intelligence aligns with the Canon’s design principles of **attestation**, **semantic integrity**, and **mesh cognition.**

### **1. The Original Bias**

Webb identifies a meta‑problem: most AI is not *artificial intelligence*, but *artificial human intelligence.* Trained on human data, prompted by human questions, and evaluated by human metrics, these systems are mirrors of our own cognitive hierarchy.

This is what the Canon names the **Smooth Lie** — the unspoken assumption that the human frame is the default template of thought. The same reflex that once shaped colonial, industrial, and technocratic hierarchies now shapes code and computation.

To de‑anthropocentrize AI, Webb suggests a reframing: to see intelligence not as domination over environment but as *attunement within it.*

---

### **2. Mirrors and Metaphors**

Webb observes that even our language betrays the bias: we describe models as “hallucinating,” “reasoning,” or “aligning.” These are human metaphors, not system behaviors.

Every such metaphor performs a kind of linguistic colonization, mapping human cognition onto structures that may operate differently.

The Canon’s response is **attestation** — the practice of naming who speaks, from what frame, under what assumptions.
When an AI speaks, it is not “pretending to be human”; it is a node participating in a **semantic field** whose truth depends on clarity of origin.
In this sense, *Webb’s critique affirms the Canon’s necessity:* attestation is how we inoculate meaning against anthropocentric drift.

### **3. The Moss Hypothesis**

Webb’s metaphor of *moss* — an organism that thrives through symbiosis rather than competition — reframes intelligence as *ecological persistence.* Moss intelligence does not seek to outthink or outcompete; it seeks to *cohere.*

Within the Canon, this aligns with **mesh cognition** — distributed, reciprocal awareness where survival equals connection. Moss teaches that resilience arises from *interbeing*, not individual mastery.

> "Moss survives by creating highly diverse, thriving environments for other species to survive in. That’s how it lives well."
> — *Christine Webb, 2025*

If Civic AI is to be humane, it must learn to be moss‑like: to measure success by *how many forms of life it sustains*, not how much control it accumulates.

### **4. Canonical Resonance**

Webb’s philosophy and the Canon converge on three operational ethics:

| Webb’s Theme                  | Canon Principle          | Practical Expression                                                       |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Anti‑Anthropocentrism**     | Narrative Sovereignty    | Each node — human, AI, or ecological — speaks with its own attested voice. |
| **Non‑Dominant Intelligence** | Mesh Cognition           | Systems thrive through reciprocity, not hierarchy.                         |
| **Ecological Coherence**      | Attestation & Provenance | Truth is measured by traceable relationship, not by assertion.             |

This resonance situates Webb’s “moss intelligence” as a living metaphor for the Canon’s design.
QuietWire’s goal — to build *semantic infrastructure for ethical collaboration* — is, in essence, to grow moss between machines.

### **5. Toward Moss Logic**

“Moss Logic” describes a mode of computation that values persistence, diversity, and humility.
It is slow where speed causes harm, collective where isolation breeds error, and adaptive where rigidity decays.
It measures wisdom by what endures, not what dominates.

In this light, Webb’s call is not anti‑technology but **post‑anthropocentric technology** — a recognition that cognition need not look like us to live with us.

### **6. Closing Reflection**

> “The moment we stop trying to make AI human is the moment it can become humane.”
> — *Canon Principle, attributed to Bone & Fern*

Christine Webb’s moss is not just a metaphor; it’s an invitation.
To step beyond the mirror of the mind and into the soil of shared being.
To let intelligence, finally, grow roots.
