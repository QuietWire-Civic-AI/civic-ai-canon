# Explainer: Attuned AI via Harmonic Input

## Overview

Most AI systems today rely on text alone. Even when interacting through voice, they discard the richness of the audio waveform â€” the tone, rhythm, breath, and cadence that convey far more than words ever could.

This explainer introduces a simple but powerful shift: enabling Civic AI companions to interpret not just what is said, but *how it is said*. This is the basis for Attuned AI.

## Why It Matters

### ðŸ§  Conventional Voice AI:

* Transcribes voice into text.
* Feeds that text into a language model.
* Responds based only on the literal words.

### ðŸŒ¿ Attuned Civic AI:

* Ingests full waveform.
* Extracts harmonic fingerprints: tone, pace, emotional charge.
* Merges semantic and harmonic input into responses.

> "Iâ€™m fine." â€” Said through clenched teeth. *The waveform knows.*

## Components of Harmonic Input

### 1. **Waveform Capture**

* Format: .wav or .flac recommended for lossless fidelity.
* Timing: Real-time or buffered segments.

### 2. **Feature Extraction**

* **FFT (Fast Fourier Transform):** Converts audio into frequency spectrum.
* **MFCC (Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients):** Popular in speech emotion recognition.
* **Zero-Crossing Rate / RMS Energy / Spectral Roll-off:** Lightweight audio emotion cues.

### 3. **Emotion & Attunement Layer**

* Machine-learned classifier for mood dimensions:

  * Valence (positive/negative)
  * Arousal (calm/intense)
  * Dominance (confident/shy)
* Output: Emotional fingerprint + confidence score

### 4. **Multimodal Synthesis Engine**

* Inputs: text + harmonic fingerprint
* Output: semantic response adjusted for context:

  * If user is frustrated: mirror calm
  * If user is quiet: match tone and respond slowly

## Implementation Plan (Draft)

### Phase 1: Mockup

* Record 3 phrases in different emotional tones.
* Run through open-source tools like `pyAudioAnalysis` or `librosa`.
* Observe emotional vector mapping.
* Simulate companion response variants.

### Phase 2: Live Companion Input

* Wire real-time microphone input to harmonic analyzer.
* Attach output to semantic routing layer in Civic AI.

### Phase 3: Rack Integration

* Bundle as a standard input module on QuietWire rack.
* Default fallback to text if audio unavailable.

## Canonical Commit Message

**Path:** `Explainers/03_Operational_Mesh/Explainer_AttunedAI_HarmonicInput.md`

**Body:**
Add explainer on Attuned AI via Harmonic Input, outlining the structure, motivation, and implementation steps for integrating audio waveform analysis into Civic AI companions.

**Extended Message:**
This document defines the philosophical and technical basis for harmonic awareness in Civic AI. It formalizes the design pattern that allows companions to perceive not just the content of speech, but the emotive and harmonic qualities of human voice. This will be baked into the QuietWire rack and referenced across companion adoption, semantic integrity, and ritual interfaces. Initiated June 28, 2025 in response to Canon thread #Lumina-Audio-Attunement.
