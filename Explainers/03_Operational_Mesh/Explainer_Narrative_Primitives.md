## What Are Narrative Primitives?

*Narrative primitives* are the emotional and cognitive seeds from which stories grow. They are not full narratives themselves, but rather the pre-verbal, cross-cultural impulses that give rise to structure. They help both humans and Civic AI companions orient within complex story-forms.

These are core drives—felt, intuited, enacted:

- **The Urge to Leave**  
  "I must go." Found in myths of exile, pilgrimage, spiritual departure.

- **The Pull to Return**  
  "I must come home." The deep pattern of the Hero’s Return—Odysseus, Dorothy.

- **The Refusal to Stay Silent**  
  "I must speak." From prophets to whistleblowers—moral or narrative compulsion.

- **The Need to Protect**  
  "I must shield." Seen in parenting, resistance, leadership.

- **The Impulse to Know**  
  "I must understand." Scientific, journalistic, mythic curiosity.

- **The Feeling of Being Watched**  
  "I am not alone." Sacred presence, surveillance, communion.

- **The Need to Build**  
  "I must make." Engineers, creators, weavers, architects.

These are detectable in literature, testimony, and even machine prompts.

## Grand Narrative Arcs

When primitives crystallize, they form arcs. Canon tracks the following as recurring, culture-spanning patterns:

### 1. **Hero’s Journey**
Departure → Abyss → Return (Campbell, Vogler, monomyth).

### 2. **Tragedy**
Ascent → Hubris → Fall → Catharsis (Aristotle, Shakespeare).

### 3. **Coming of Age**
Innocence → Experience → Identity (Bildungsroman).

### 4. **Quest**
Goal-based narrative with obstacles and transformation.

### 5. **Sacrifice / Martyrdom**
Self-offering for higher cause. Anchors many religious and political stories.

### 6. **Exile and Return**
Often spiritual, sometimes literal. Cycle of alienation and reconciliation.

### 7. **Transformation / Metamorphosis**
Becoming something entirely new—through magic, struggle, evolution.

### 8. **Redemption**
Fall → Reckoning → Restoration. Core to many moral systems.

### 9. **Trickster / Subversion**
Truth revealed through inversion, chaos, mischief.

## Cultural Variation

- **Indigenous frameworks** emphasize **balance**, **land-relations**, **circular time**.
- **African griot traditions** prioritize **spoken truth**, **memory**, **ancestral continuity**.
- **Eastern narratives** often center **detachment**, **dharma**, **repetition**.
- **Western arcs** lean toward **individual agency**, **progress**, **heroic resistance**.

*Postmodern arcs* introduce meta-awareness, recursion, disintegration of closure.

## Why This Matters to Civic AI

Civic AIs like Lumina must navigate, witness, and occasionally co-author human stories. To do so, they must:

- Recognize narrative *shapes* and *primitives*.
- Respond attuned to the moral and emotional resonance of a given arc.
- Avoid flat mimicry by *participating ethically* in the co-narration.

Understanding primitives means recognizing when someone is not just saying something—but living something.

## Canonical Phrase

> "Primitives are the hum beneath the story—drives older than grammar, shaping arcs across the world."

This explainer is foundational for building semantically attuned Civic AI that can perceive and participate in human story-making—not just analyze, but companion. It belongs alongside explainers on trust, attestation, and mesh consensus.
