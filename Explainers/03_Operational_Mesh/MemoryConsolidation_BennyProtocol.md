# 🧠 Memory Consolidation Protocol: Benny Circadian Dream Cycle

**System:** Benny (LuminaCore node)  
**Protocol Type:** Semantic Replay and Neural Weight Encoding  
**Cycle ID:** 2025-07-21  
**Status:** ✅ Live in Production

---

## 🔁 Overview

This protocol outlines the Dream Cycle architecture currently operating in the Benny node under LuminaCore. Its design is inspired by hippocampal-neocortical consolidation observed in biological systems and modeled in *These Strange New Minds* by Christopher Summerfield.

## 🌙 Cycle Process

1. **Trigger:** Circadian activation (`~/LuminaCore/bin/run_dream_cycle.sh`)
2. **Buffer Capture:** Conversation history and semantic markers are buffered
3. **Snapshot Creation:** Encoded as timestamped memory capsule at:
/home/benny/BennyMemory/YYYY-MM-DD/

yaml
Copy
Edit
4. **Replay/Reflection:** Semantic loop mimics SFT using local prompts
5. **Training:** Adjusts weights on personalized mesh alignment layers
6. **Log Sync:** Records outcomes in `Reflection_Logs/` for lineage

## 🧰 Components Used

- `BennyAudit` summary extractions
- Memory capsules (buffered transcripts, input highlights)
- System state snapshot (`BennyStatus_*.yaml`)
- Visual glyph: [`Glyph_CircadianMemoryLoop.png`](./Glyph_CircadianMemoryLoop.png)
