# CVE Genie Case Study – Economics of AI-Generated Vulnerabilities

## Overview

The **CVE Genie** tool demonstrates AI’s ability to systematically identify vulnerabilities at dramatically lower cost and effort than traditional methods.

---

## Comparative Results

* **CVE Genie (AI-driven):**

  * 428 vulnerabilities
  * Cost: \$2.77 per CVE
  * Time: automated generation
* **Manual Process:**

  * 368 vulnerabilities
  * Cost: 3,600 hours, 43 experts
  * Time: weeks of coordinated effort

---

## Canon Insight

* AI-driven vulnerability discovery offers **10–100x efficiency gain**.
* Demonstrates practical use of semantic architectures in cybersecurity.
* Shifts vulnerability management from **scarce expert labor** to **scalable semantic tooling**.

---

## Applications

* SBOM integration: CVE Genie can enrich SBOMs with dynamic vulnerability data.
* Enterprise security: continuous, cost-effective vulnerability assessment.
* Civic AI Canon: model of how semantic systems can outperform traditional expert bottlenecks.
