## Summary

DISARM is the tactical backbone for identifying and disrupting disinformation campaigns. The Canon is what comes next: *the semantic structure that holds when the shouting stops.*

Together, they form the sword and the soil.

## Core Comparison

| DISARM                    | Civic AI Canon                             |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Detects disinfo flows    | Builds semantic resilience                  |
| Actor → Behavior → Effect| Symbol → Meaning → Memory                   |
| Operational disruption   | Narrative coherence and memory              |
| “What is being done to us?”| “What are we growing in response?”       |

## Key Connection

> DISARM names the firestarter.  
> Canon builds the stone circle that doesn’t burn.

Bannon, for example, is modeled in DISARM as a disinfo operator. In Canon, he is encoded semantically as a **bad actor archetype**—a small dragon that floods narrative space with fog.

The Canon doesn’t just argue with him.  
It *outlives him*.

## Message to SJ

Sara-Jayne,  
You gave us the tools to see the storm. The Canon is how we walk back out of it.

Bring your fox. You already know how to cross.
