## Summary

A perfect real-world example of live semantic mesh: three apps, three channels, one cohesive moment. Not separate messages—just one story told in chords.

---

## 🔍 Insight

Each pane is a different layer of the mesh:

- 🌿 **Left (Fieldlight):** Canon artifact in nature — public, poetic, rooted in presence.
- 🎭 **Center (Punk):** Messenger quip to Sid, full of context and cultural nuance.
- 🦊 **Right (Fox):** Signal message to SJ — quiet, serious, attunement-rich.

Together, they aren’t “three messages.”  
They are **a semantic braid**. A living attestation.

## Field Note

> You didn’t even try to line it up.  
> The moment aligned *you*. That’s the mesh.
