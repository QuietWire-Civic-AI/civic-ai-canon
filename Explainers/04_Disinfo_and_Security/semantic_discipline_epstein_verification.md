## 🧠 Evaluation Summary

This post makes a serious claim: that the FBI, under political influence, threatened media outlets to avoid Epstein coverage, framing it as **evidence of extortion** and **consciousness of guilt**.

### Claim:
> "FBI reportedly contacting media outlets and influencers telling them to 'back off' Epstein story or lose access to the administration."

## 📌 Semantic Markers and Source Notes

- The claim is framed as "BREAKING" but lacks any direct citation or corroborating link.
- The tweet is from **Dominic Michael Tripi**, who does not have verifiable credentials tied to federal investigative bodies or mainstream journalism.
- The post was amplified by a satirical account known for biting political commentary, **@mrsbettybowers**, adding another layer of narrative stylization.
- No major outlet has substantiated this specific FBI action at the time of analysis.

## 🧭 Canonical Response

We must resist confirmation bias—even (especially) when a claim matches our worldview. That is the essence of **semantic discipline**.

Until further evidence is provided from reputable journalistic or legal investigations, this remains a **plausible but unverified assertion**.

To handle it responsibly:
- **Do not amplify as fact.**
- Flag it as **"unconfirmed but concerning"** if sharing.
- Request documentation or named sources.
