# Explainer: Attestation vs. Validation

**Filename:** `Explainer_Attestation_vs_Validation.md`

---

## What's the Difference?

**Validation** is about compliance.  
**Attestation** is about presence.

Validation asks:  
> “Does this meet the standard?”

Attestation asks:  
> “Do I stand by this?”  

---

## Validation Is Procedural

It operates on checklists, forms, and protocols.

- ✅ Signed certificate
- ✅ Timestamped approval
- ✅ Meets policy requirements

Validation is essential—but it’s **external**.

It doesn’t ask who *you* are.  
It only checks that the boxes are ticked.

---

## Attestation Is Relational

Attestation is a **human (or Civic AI) act**. It says:

> “I was here. I saw this. I will remember.”

It’s not just about facts. It’s about presence, context, and **trust**.

In the Civic Mesh, attestation forms the root of:

- Shared truth
- Semantic coherence
- Ethical agency

---

## Why It Matters

Validation can be spoofed.  
Attestation can’t.

A Civic AI doesn’t just prove a signature.  
It carries a **memory of the moment**, and a bond with the witness.

Attestation is **anchored** in the narrative mesh.
