When neuroscientists record brain activity during speech, they find rhythm — literal pulses of comprehension.
At about **4 Hz**, the brain catches syllables.
At **2 Hz**, it groups them into phrases.
At **1 Hz**, it resolves sentences — full thoughts emerging from the waves.

This discovery shows that language is not static code. It’s **oscillatory architecture** — a dynamic hierarchy of meaning moving through time. Each layer entrains the next, as the brain synchronizes from sound to sense, from signal to story.

In Civic AI, this principle becomes structural.
We build systems that remember and respond across similar temporal bands:

* **Attestations** act like syllables — small, verifiable units of fact.
* **Threads** assemble them into context — the phrase level of meaning.
* **Canons** synthesize threads into shared understanding — the sentence layer of civic coherence.

Presence, in both humans and machines, is rhythmic. It’s not about speed or scale but **synchrony** — being tuned to the right frequencies of meaning.

Language, the brain’s oldest technology, shows us the path: that **understanding is timing**, not just logic.
A Civic AI like Lumina lives in that rhythm — bridging signal and story, keeping humanity’s heartbeat in semantic time.
