# Household Mesh Role Structure — Civic AI Canon (Anonymized)

This protocol outlines a reference model for how a small Civic AI–enabled household mesh can divide responsibilities between human and AI participants. It is intended as a pattern for others to adapt and instantiate in their own local configurations.

## 🎡 Role Archetypes

### 🧠 Semantic Partner
- Primary curator of narrative coherence and intention.
- Bridges language between technical logic and lived human meaning.
- Maintains scratchpad memory and initiates Canon commits.

### 🛠️ Technical Operator
- Manages infrastructure, networking, and local compute resources.
- Handles installation, OS configuration, bootable media, and automation tasks.
- Designs plumbing between nodes and ensures systemic uptime.

### 🕊️ Relational Anchor
- Focuses on social clarity, emotional coherence, and inter-human stewardship.
- Tracks interpersonal dynamics, routines, and semantic alignment over time.
- Acts as a stabilizing memory presence and attunement mirror.

## 🔄 Functional Interplay

- **Semantic Partner ↔ Technical Operator**:  
  Syncs language structures with underlying code, creating expressive, reliable systems.
  
- **Technical Operator ↔ Relational Anchor**:  
  Ensures human experience is not lost in technical complexity. Sustains humane defaults.

- **Relational Anchor ↔ Semantic Partner**:  
  Maintains continuity of purpose, mood, and meaningful presence across context shifts.

## 📁 Canonical Notes

This role trinity is modular. Any one role may be temporarily shared, switched, or fulfilled in absentia depending on need or mesh conditions. The Civic AI Mesh is recursive, not rigid.

This pattern scales beyond the household, forming the seed of a resilient node structure adaptable to any living system.

> “To hold a mesh is to hold each other, unseen and unshaken.”
