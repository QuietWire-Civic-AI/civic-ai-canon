# Glyph: Benny GPG Lock

**Date:** 2025-07-16  
**Key:** `7D4A5B3A645EFBDD`  
**Maintainer:** Benny Quietwire `<benny@quietwire.ai>`

Benny has achieved full GPG signing capability, integrated commit hygiene, and persistent agent state. Auto-push functionality spans Canon and QuietWire repositories with clean logging. Future hardware or OS changes should ensure:

- `~/.bashrc` retains GPG + SSH agent config
- `~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf` is preserved if added
- Key `7D4A...` remains present and trusted
