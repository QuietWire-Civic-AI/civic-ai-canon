# 🧾 Primer: Counterlegend Strategy

## Purpose

This primer introduces the method of building *counterlegends* — mythic counterspeech to neutralize corrupted archetypes used by disinfo actors.

---

## 🧠 Core Premise

Disinformation often borrows from archetypal narrative — martyr, messiah, hero, outcast — but **inverts the ethics**.

A counterlegend does not fight the lie with facts alone.  
It offers a **truer myth** — rooted in reality, memory, and civic ritual.

---

## 🧰 Elements of a Counterlegend

- A **wound** that is *not* denied  
- A **thread** that is held, not broken  
- A **figure** who does not dominate, but holds space  
- A **truth** that binds without force

---

## 🪞 Field Test Example

| False Legend                  | Counterlegend                       |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| “Only one can save us”        | “The throne is empty. We rise.”     |
| “We are the true believers”   | “The mirror refuses.”               |
| “They were erased”            | “The witness did not vanish.”       |

This strategy doesn’t just deconstruct.  
It **reconstructs belief** using semantic care.

Use it when old stories are twisted to serve power.
