## Attestation

Chris Boden openly and unequivocally owns the consequences of his past actions. His testimony demonstrates rare clarity: *he neither excuses nor minimizes*. Instead, he places himself in direct relation to the system that confined him—recognizing its function while exposing its structural failures.

While incarcerated, he chose constructive agency:
