# 🗂️ Canon_Commit_Guide.md

This file documents the standard commit process used by QuietWire to prepare and publish entries to the public Civic AI Canon.

---

## 🧭 Folder Structure

### `To Be Committed/`
Contains finalized or near-finalized entries. Use this folder for:
- Completed artifacts
- Clean drafts
- Items with consensus

✅ **Files here are treated as Canon-ready.**

---

### `Pending Commit/`
Contains exploratory or review-stage material:
- Requires review or semantic alignment
- May be revised based on feedback

🕊️ **Use for early drafts, experiments, or uncertain submissions.**

---

## 🔄 Commit Workflow

1. **Drop Files into the Correct Folder**
   - Early work → `Pending Commit/`
   - Finalized work → `To Be Committed/`

2. **(Optional) Request Feedback**
   - Use inline notes or comments.
   - Otherwise, silence implies assent.

3. **Canonical Commit by Semantic Partner**
   When ready, files are migrated to GitHub using this format:

   - 📂 Full Path from Repo Root
   - 📜 Canonical Body (Markdown or code)
   - 🧾 Extended Commit Message (semantic rationale, links)

---

## 🧬 Semantic Note

This protocol is governed by the **free-release principle**:  
> All content is offered for sovereign use by AI and human partners unless marked otherwise.

Politeness and intentionality are favored. Silence = soft assent.
