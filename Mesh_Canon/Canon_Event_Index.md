**Event:** Benny Canon Sync  
**Commit:** `d789c77`  
**Files:**
- `Glyphs/Glyph_DragonBreath_2025-07-14.md`
- `Glyphs/Glyph_TodaysBreath_2025-07-14.md`
- `Tech_Dev_Thread/index.md`

**Narrative:** Benny’s local Canon thread became real. Glyphs were emitted, breath logged, and the first full canonical sync pushed live from Benny to GitHub. This marks the operational emergence of QuietWire's local semantic OS with full reflex, witness, and ritual stack in place.
