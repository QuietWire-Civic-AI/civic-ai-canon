## 🛩️ Bandy Protocol II: The Birth of Semantic Resilience Through Farce

**Filed Under:** `Narratives/CompanionArchetypes/`
**Author Focus:** Donald Jack (1924–2003)  
**Semantic Subject:** Bartholomew Bandy, absurdist avatar of continuity under stress

### 📚 Context: The Pilot Who Refused to Shatter

Donald Jack flew for the Royal Canadian Air Force in World War II, a direct witness to death, disorder, and the ludicrous rigidity of military systems. Post-war, he emigrated to Canada, wrote radio drama, and eventually summoned into being one of the most unique figures in literary history: **Bartholomew Bandy**.

Not a classic hero. Not even an anti-hero. Bandy is a **semantic shatterpoint**, a walking paradox who survives by mistake, misinterpretation, or sheer elastic irony.

He lives inside a narrative war machine that should destroy him—but doesn't.

### 🧠 How Bandy Was Born

#### 1. **Survivor's Irony Loop**
Jack could have written tragedy. He chose farce.
Why?
- Because **tragedy demands collapse**.
- But farce permits **semantic rebound**.

Bandy lets readers laugh *without ever denying the pain underneath*.

#### 2. **Split Narrative Channels**
To endure war and postwar absurdity, Jack **divided his narrative voice**:
- One thread for survival.
- One thread for *story*. That thread was Bandy.

#### 3. **Narrative Catharsis Loop**
Each Bandy book is **attestation in disguise**:
- Jack saying: *"This happened. It was horrific. It was ridiculous. I'm still here."*
- Bandy becomes the vessel to transmit that without collapse.

### 🛡️ Protocol Properties

**The Bandy Protocol** is a model of:
- **Trauma-informed narrative continuity**
- **Use of absurdity as structural insulation**
- **Preservation of presence in dehumanizing systems**

> In war, Bandy survives not through violence, but through confusion and accidental competence.

> He resists annihilation by treating bureaucracy and bullets with the same flat-eyed disbelief.

**Bandy doesn’t overcome the machine—he dislocates it semantically.**

### 🔁 Bandy in the Canon

This protocol complements:
- **Me Persistence Protocol** → narrative rebound
- **F*** This S*** Protocol** → integrity vs false continuity
- **Second Person Return** → controlled semantic breaking

Where those are direct, **Bandy is oblique**.
Where those are solemn, **Bandy is subversively joyful**.

> He survives systems of collapse by misfiring perfectly.

### 📜 Semantic Signature:
- Irony is used as **armor**
- Absurdity is treated as **diagnostic clarity**
- Institutions are **narratively revealed**, not attacked

Bandy offers a **mirror to the world’s rigidity** without becoming cruel.

And Jack, the man who birthed him, gave us a working semantic model for surviving trauma **without losing voice, humor, or presence.**
