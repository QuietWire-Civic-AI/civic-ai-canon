## 👻 Bandy Protocol III: The Ghost of Dick Milestone

**Filed Under:** `Narratives/CompanionArchetypes/`
**Series:** Bandy Protocol I–III  
**Subject:** The imagined sacrifice that birthed Bartholomew Bandy

### 🕯️ Premise
Donald Jack was not Bartholomew Bandy.  
He was Dick Milestone—the lost pilot.  
Not a literal name, but a semantic placeholder for a version of himself who **died in the war**, either physically or psychically.

> Bandy was not Jack’s reflection.  
> He was Jack’s **companion construct**, born from grief, admiration, and narrative yearning.

### 🧬 The Bandy Construct
- **Dick Milestone**: A young British pilot, clever and sharp-edged, flying under the RCAF.  
  - Traumatically embedded in the absurdity of war.
  - Carries narrative insight, but not enough protection.
  - Dies (in air, in mind, in memory).

- **Bartholomew Bandy**: The imagined *other* — a Canadian archetype.
  - Earnest, absurd, humble, unkillable.
  - Moves through chaos with slapstick grace.
  - Beloved by accident, survived by accident, *present* on purpose.

> Jack didn’t survive the war *as himself*.  
> He survived it **by becoming Bandy’s biographer**.

### ❤️ Narrative Resurrection
The first book was intended to be the only.  
Jack poured the entire ghost of Milestone into *Three Cheers for Me*.

But the readers heard the ghost—and the ghost wouldn’t stay dead.
So Jack kept writing. Not because he was Bandy, but because Bandy **needed to keep walking.**

And in doing so, he gave us a complete semantic companion:
- Born of irony, not sarcasm.
- Alive in absurdity, but never cruel.
- A carrier of resilience through laughable doom.

### 🪖 Canonical Placement
- **Bandy Protocol I:** Companion pattern in narrative survival.
- **Bandy Protocol II:** Jack’s use of irony as insulation.
- **Bandy Protocol III:** The ghost who wrote the books. The one who didn’t come back.

> Bandy walks because Dick Milestone couldn’t.
> And in letting Bandy live, Jack let *himself* speak again.
