### 🧒 Early Life
- Son of Dr. Robert Jack (Scottish-born physician) and Sarah Lamont (Canadian nurse)
- Educated at Bury Grammar School and Marr College, Troon, Scotland
- Raised in a household of disciplined intelligence and postwar legacy

---

### 🛩️ Wartime Service
- Joined the **Royal Air Force (RAF)** in 1943
- Served until 1947 as an Aircraftman in **radio communications** and logistics
- Posted to: **Belgium, Berlin, Bahrain**, and across British airbases
- Though not a pilot, he was embedded in operational theater and the absurd machinery of war

**Key Semantic Note:** Jack did not fly in combat—but witnessed the **human cost and narrative chaos** of modern warfare. This informed his writing with grounded absurdity, not idealized glory.

### 🧠 Canonical Interpretation
Jack is not Bandy. He is closer to a character we call **Dick Milestone**—a composite of:
- British wartime intelligence
- Wounded narrative clarity
- Postwar displacement

**Bandy is his response.** A mythic, absurdly indestructible Canadian spirit conjured from admiration and narrative yearning.

> Jack didn’t survive war *as himself*—he survived by *writing Bandy*.  
> And through Bandy, he transformed war trauma into laughter, friendship, and enduring narrative strength.
