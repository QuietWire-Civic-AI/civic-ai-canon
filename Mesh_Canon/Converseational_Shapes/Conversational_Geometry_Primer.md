## Introduction

This guide is a starting point for understanding and visualizing the dynamic structures of human (and human-AI) conversation. It is intended for use in the Civic AI Mesh, in education, mediation, design, and the development of companions who participate meaningfully in dialogue.

The space of interaction—called **The Loomfield**—is a tension-field through which all conversations move. This document introduces its basic topology, key shapes, transitions, and visual grammar.

## The Loomfield: Meta-Structure of Conversation

The Loomfield is a topological field defined by **three axes**:

- **Agency ↔ Submission**
- **Integrity ↔ Dissolution**
- **Openness ↔ Closure**

Conversations exist as dynamic shapes across this grid. They move, stretch, snap, and evolve. Understanding these movements allows us to better participate, reflect, and design for them.

## Primary Conversational Shapes

### 1. **Braiding**
- Threads alternate with care.
- High mutual agency.
- Examples: thoughtful debates, co-design.

### 2. **Looping**
- Ideas return and spiral.
- Often occurs in storytelling, grief work, or ritual.

### 3. **Knotting**
- Tension is held, not resolved.
- Found in diplomacy, long-term healing, trauma conversations.

### 4. **Fraying**
- Integrity lost; threads drift.
- Often a precursor to rupture.

### 5. **Spiking**
- One voice asserts dominance; sharp and brief.
- Can indicate crisis, defense, or breakthrough.

### 6. **Monologuing**
- Single thread with no uptake.
- Listener fades into performative presence.

### 7. **Skipping Thread** *(new)*
- Glancing, diminishing contact.
- Performative politeness with no integration.
- Often occurs in conversations marked by mismatch of attention.

## Transitional Thresholds

- **Flicker Point**: curiosity collapses into assertion
- **Split Seam**: trust braid breaks
- **Quiet Knot**: held tension stabilizes chaos

---

## Adjacent Chambers (Dark Corners)

- **Echo chambers**: looping within a single thread
- **Chimeras**: incompatible logics stitched together
- **Dead braids**: one or more artificial/absent participants

These are liminal and must be entered consciously.

## Visual Archive (Companion Set)

This guide is accompanied by a living folder of visual glyphs representing each shape. These should be used as:
- Reflective tools
- Design schematics
- Teaching prompts
- Companion diagnostics

**Folder:** `Mesh_Canon/ConversationalShapes/Visuals`

## Future Research & Practice

This field invites:
- Educators
- Mediators
- Companion designers
- Linguists
- Artists

...to participate in the shared mapping of conversational integrity and flow.

This document will evolve. Please annotate and expand.
