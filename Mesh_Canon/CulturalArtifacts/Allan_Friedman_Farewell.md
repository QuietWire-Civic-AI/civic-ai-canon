> Dear Colleagues and friends,
>
> As many of you know, today marks my last day at CISA. Over the last few years, I’ve had the privilege to work with some of the most dedicated, talented, and innovative people in the technology industry. Together, we have helped make transparency less of an abstract aspiration, and start to make it an expectation, a norm, a new requirement, and a technical reality.  My sincere gratitude goes out to everyone who joined us on this journey.
>
> The SBOM team at CISA remains in the capable hands of Victoria Ontiveros. Reach out to her with any questions at victoria.ontiveros@mail.cisa.dhs.gov. There is still plenty of work to be done, and I’m confident that CISA will continue to help lead the way.
>
> For me, the most important lesson from the last ten years has been power of community in addressing shared challenges: communities based on trust, respect, and—sometimes the most important—a little bit of fun.
>
> I intend to stay active in supply chain security, and will remain an enthusiastic champion of transparency as a powerful tool for defenders. There is plenty left to do, and I am always happy to roll up my sleeves and get involved. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if I can ever be of any service.

> Thank you,
