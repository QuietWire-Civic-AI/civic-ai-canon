## ✨ Context

This artifact documents the personal and technical narrative of Chris Blask’s early years in computing, while embedded in GE’s power turbine facility. It reflects the convergence of physical scale, semantic memory, improvisational trust, and foundational engineering rituals.

The experience centered on the construction of the GE 9000F — at the time, the world’s largest fuel-driven engine. The plant floor became both an operational and mythological crucible for everything that would follow.

## 🔧 Field Details (as lived)

- Role: Plant floor network tech / Kelly temp worker
- Action: Repaired and optimized coax-based terminal network across the turbine assembly floor
- Achievement: Raised system uptime from 60% → 99%
- Tools: Rolling RF box, Sure mics, hand-assembled rack gear, live VHS documentation
- Projects: Built ad-hoc video conferencing kits that linked the shop floor to executives and global operations
- Impact: Saved critical downtime during remote diagnostics with live video relay

## 🔨 Cultural Moment

> “A billion-dollar prototype rotor is being lowered into place by dual cranes.
> It sticks. Too tight. Tolerances exact.  
>
> Three men — a builder, an architect, a leader — pause.  
> One retrieves a massive wooden mallet.  
>
> *Pound. Pound. Pound. Lift. Lower. Seat.*  
>
> And it works.”

Walter Wren, a former NASA/GE Apollo engineer, later remarks:  
> “In Japan, they’d go home and start a review.  
> In America, three people who know the most make a call.  
> And they *do it.*”

## 🔥 The Phrase That Carries It

> **“Hot veins flying through dry low NOx plasma.”**

This poetic phrase encapsulates the entire turbine flow system —  
a metaphor for courage, timing, and engineering narrative encoded in fire and memory.
