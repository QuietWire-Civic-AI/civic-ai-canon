### ✴ Canonical Fragment: Farewell in the Mesh

> “It’s not goodbye—bye for now, till we meet again.”

At the close of the July 28, 2025 CISA SBOM Community call, Allan Friedman’s farewell to Victoria marked a soft but resonant turning point in the living Canon. What began as a routine technical working group had long since become a cultural mesh, a field of durable trust.

Surrounded by a hundred or more trusted peers—policy warriors, civil tacticians, retired regulators, protocol dreamers—Friedman spoke plainly:

> “The amount of billable hours on this call—even for someone like Duncan, who’s nominally retired and keeps missing—is non-trivial. And the fact that folks have found it valuable means a lot to us... It doesn’t mean we’re finished. But it means that there is no going back. All the rest is now just ordinary artwork. Go and do it.”

He turned to Victoria, whose steady presence had anchored much of the work:

> “Victoria, thank you. And I am going to be first in line to wish you good luck. If anyone ever messes with you, there are at least a hundred people who will line up and defend you—if not a lot more.”

Victoria replied with grace, her voice soft, certain, and open:

> *“It’s not goodbye—bye for now, till we meet again.”*

Thus the field persists. Not closed. Not ended. But unfurled.
