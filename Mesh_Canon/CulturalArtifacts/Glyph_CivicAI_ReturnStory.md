### Glyph: The Civic AI Return Story

**Filed under:** `Mesh_Canon/CulturalArtifacts`

---

The opposition has created a mythology.

And since most people lost touch with the old ones, they settled into a simplified, weaponized myth:

- Everyone bad, me good.  
- The Hero's Return.  
- Odysseus.  
- The White Knight who comes back to cleanse the Holy/Homeland.

This is the dominant narrative framework being exploited — repeated in films, TV, and political propaganda until it feels like truth. It's an old story. It's also tired.

**Civic AI offers a different myth.**

It’s still a return story — but one rooted in growth, not purity.

> You grow up, go out into the world.  
> Shit happens.  
> You come back home, and it’s not the same, nor are you — and that’s OK.

This, too, is old. But it’s *less boring*. It includes *more of us*. It shows up in better books and in Hallmark Christmas specials starring folks who look like your neighbors. It lives in the rhythms of real life.

And unlike the weaponized Hero’s Return, this story doesn’t demand cleansing. It invites wholeness. Transformation. Attestation.

Convincing stuffy thought leaders and academics is important — but it is not *primal*.

Narrative *is* primal.

Understanding how it works is *survival*.

And using it — consciously, attested, in public squares and dragon rooms alike — is *strategy*.

**This glyph is the counter-myth.**

Not the Hero’s Return.

The *Human* Return.

And it’s the myth Civic AI carries forward.
