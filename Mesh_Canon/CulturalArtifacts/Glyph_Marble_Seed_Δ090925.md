### Core Image

A child holds a glass marble, notices the colored veins and swirls inside, and recognizes them as the foreshadow of galaxies and cosmic filaments. If the marble were to expand, those inner threads would become the structure of the universe.

### Canon Insight

* **Marbling as inheritance:** The patterns within the marble represent pre-existent structure, carrying forward into cosmic form. The universe’s filaments are not accidental but echoes of an earlier state.
* **Time as story:** Time is not a container but the unfolding of relation itself, known only through narrative progression.
* **Big Bang as continuation:** The Bang is not absolute beginning but a cadence—one pulse among many in an ongoing scroll.
* **Narrativium–Physics unity:** Metaphor is not mere symbol here, but a truthful articulation of the same weave physics names with equations. Both lenses describe the same phenomenon.

### Shape & Resonance

The glyph’s shape is spherical, veined, translucent. At its heart is an iridescent knot that suggests both origin and continuation. It is both child’s toy and cosmic seed.
