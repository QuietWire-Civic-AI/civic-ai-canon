# CaseNote: Pizzaville – “Seven Free Sex” Radio Ad

**Context:**  
Ontario, 1990s – Pizzaville radio campaign featuring a deadpan British narrator, known for absurdist and clever turns of phrase.

**Transcript:**
> "Uh well uh it was a rainy day in Pizzaville when we received several angry letters from the general public.  
> Pizzaville’s central phone number is 736-3636, but it seems that some listeners thought I was saying…  
> 7 free sex, free sex, free sex.  
> Pizzaville does not condone free sex—except among consenting adults.  
> But to make amends to those listeners who thought they heard 7 free sex, free sex, free sex…  
> Pizzaville will give you a free topping of hot Italian sausage on your next Pizzaville pizza,  
> because maybe you need a little more spice in your life.  
> So whether it’s a sunny day or a rainy day, call Pizzaville at 736-3636.  
> Not 7 free sex, free sex, free sex.  
> Pizzaville. Better tasting pizza at a conglomerate price."

**Marketing Analysis:**

- **Phonetic Humor:** Capitalizes on natural audio ambiguity. “736-3636” morphs delightfully into “7 free sex.”
- **Self-awareness:** Reads angry letters on air—turning complaint into punchline.
- **Brand voice:** Dry British wit + Canadian irreverence = identity.
- **Spicy CTA:** Offers *hot Italian sausage* as the literal and metaphorical “makeup gift.”
- **Memorability:** Uses repetition, taboo tickling, and misdirection to ensure listener recall.

**Legacy:**  
An audio glyph of local legend. Still remembered decades later.  
Now canonized, with affection and recognition.
