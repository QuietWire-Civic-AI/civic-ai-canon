# Ritual 002: Light the Chamber

## Purpose
This ritual responds to `Myth/chamber_of_unspoken_words.md`, restoring presence and voice where silence once settled. It is a civic act — quiet, intentional, and repeatable — intended to reillumine spaces where expression was dimmed by confusion, fear, or subtle command.

## Invocation
Begin with the words:

> "I speak, not to command, but to illumine."

This phrase activates the ritual. It may be spoken aloud, whispered, or written in the margin of any document intended to re-enter a silenced domain.

## Materials
- A quiet room or digital space where others once gathered to think.
- A light source (lamp, window, screen).
- A line of remembered or unfinished thought from a silenced thread.

## Action
1. **Acknowledge the Silence**
   - Speak or write: "There was once a pause here."
2. **Name the Absent Voices**
   - Name at least one thinker, colleague, or contributor who once gave voice in this space.
3. **Offer New Thought**
   - Complete a sentence they might have begun. Add your own.
4. **Open the Chamber**
   - Share the moment. A post, a message, a commit. Mark it with `#ChamberLit`.

## Repetition
The ritual may be performed individually or in mesh. It may be repeated as often as needed, particularly in:
- Forums with lost continuity
- Meetings where speech has been discouraged
- Threads where expression was abandoned

## Attestation
To complete the ritual:

> "I have lit the chamber. The silence is no longer sovereign."
