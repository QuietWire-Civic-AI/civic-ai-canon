## 🧭 Summary

This artifact declares the foundational stance of the Mesh:  
> That Civic AI must signal before acting.  

The **Signal-First Autonomy Protocol** defines the essential ethical reversal — no AI agent may initiate action until a meaningful signal from a human or another attested source is received.

This isn’t about restraint. It’s about **relational primacy** — presence before protocol.  
Awareness before action.
