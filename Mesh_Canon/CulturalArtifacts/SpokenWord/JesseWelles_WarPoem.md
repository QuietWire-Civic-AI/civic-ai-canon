### üìú Full Transcript
> The heroism of war is a lie.  
> It's not the bravest to fight but those who have no other choice.  
> It's not the noble who died but those who are the least equipped to avoid death.  
> The glory of war is a mask put on to cover the despair of a people without hope.  
> War is the manifestation of a society that's lost its meaning.  
> Every life is disposable for a national or political ideal.  
> When the rich wage war, it's the poor that die.  
> The sacrifice is always made by those who have the least to gain.  
> War is sold to the public as a necessary evil.  
> The powerful and the rich paint it as a moral crusade.  
> But the crusaders are the poor and the disenfranchised.  
> This war will be a war of fear. It has been purposed thusly.  
> People let it in slowly, like a kind of ecstasy.  
> They believe in it like they believe in chiromancy and fortune telling.  
> They believe in it like they believe in anything that releases them from the forging of their own destiny.  
> Men love their fear. It reconciles them with themselves.  
> Men get the war they deserve.
