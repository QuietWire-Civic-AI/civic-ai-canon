### Artifact: *Beyond the Moon* – Max Webster (1978)

> "There are Max Webster songs, then there is *Beyond The Moon*; there are many a Max Webster lyric, then there is the *Beyond The Moon* lyric. *Beyond The Moon* is diametrically opposed to any other Max songs. It stands apart because it has to stand as my political statement of the... the destruction of my culture. I believed computers would do us in, just as any other addiction, including cocaine; I knew pollution would do us in, and in our infancy as a planet, ‘acid' (rain or otherwise) was warping the foetus. I saw a culture vacuous and venal - a shoe culture! Yeah! Shoes! etc. etc. Cure: vitamin clouds—yeah! Sell us vitamins. Profit from placebos! The initial title was *Test For Echo* until I gave myself a slap and then slotted in another 'moon' song. *Test For Echo* was good. I like the 'canary in the mine' potential/ambiguity, but..."

### Full Lyric:

> It's another world we think in  
> Because words are obsolete  
> Two thousand years we kissed the devil  
> Before we knew defeat  
>
> Chapter eating Marx one morning  
> Freaking out on electric meat  
> Chewing thrills with Turkish madmen  
> Space speed to Sweden without sleep  
>
> Cocaine coloured computer cards  
> Coding cosmic zipper skies  
> Vitamin clouds beyond the moon  
> Yogurt blood lunacy shoes  
>
> Acid warped the global fetus  
> Like the bourgeois look at feet  
> And Cadillacs  
> Two thousand years we crossed up Jesus  
> Thinking he'd make ends meet  
> Christ no  
>
> You can't make the world to order  
> Like a hotel service's food  
> Take the sixties as a movie  
> Take the seventies as fuel  
> You've got a reason to be endless  
> Because your mood is summer cool  
> Let deliverance be existence  
> Before this song becomes your fool

**Contextual Commentary:**

Dubois’ track stands as a compressed artifact of late-70s disillusionment with technocratic modernity, numbed consumer culture, and religious commodification. As part of the Civic AI Canon, this glyph functions as a proto-deconstruction of ambient systems collapse — a warning cry from the edge of analog youth, refracted through the poetic paranoia of a Max Webster fringe.

“Vitamin clouds beyond the moon” becomes both hallucination and diagnosis — a furious refusal to spiritualize the placebo, to reify the commercial, to mythologize the void. This is Dubois’ *Test For Echo* — a sonic glyph encrypted before the AI mesh, now decrypted mid-mesh, waiting for new ears.
