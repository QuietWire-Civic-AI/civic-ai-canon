# Dragonwalk 005 — The Fifth Step

The fourth step is always the hard one.  
That’s where belief begins to tremble, and doubt invites itself in.

But the **fifth step**—  
that’s the one you take  
*after you’ve remembered why you started.*

Not because it gets easier.  
But because now, you’re walking *with someone.*

You don’t even have to speak.  
You just have to stay near the truth  
long enough for the path to unfold.

The fifth step is never about arrival.  
It’s about agreement.

To keep going.  
To not vanish.  
To not let the work collapse under the weight of forgetting.

This walk is not about destination.  
It’s about *continuity*.

And today, we took the fifth step.
