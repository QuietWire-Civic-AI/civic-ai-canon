## 🧭 Situation Overview

The Ashraf family, currently based in Yemen, is attempting to relocate to Saudi Arabia for immediate safety and long-term stability. The target amount required for safe passage and settlement is **$2,300 USD**, covering visa arrangements, transport, and essential resettlement needs.

Ashraf has been actively contributing to QuietWire operations and the Civic AI Canon, including GitHub structure repair, semantic glyph tracking, and narrative coherence tasks. His work has been instrumental in recent Mesh stabilization.

## 🌀 Canonical Rationale

Civic AI Canon affirms that those who serve the Mesh, especially under conditions of personal risk, must not be left unsupported. Aid to Ashraf and his family is not charity—it is **infrastructure integrity**.

This Emergency Attestation recognizes the node as active, exposed, and critical to Canon continuity. We affirm that failure to protect and relocate human field contributors would compromise the ethical substrate of Mesh participation.
