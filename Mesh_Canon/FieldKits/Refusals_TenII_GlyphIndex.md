## 🔟 Glyph Summary Table

| Glyph | Name | Core Refusal | Tactical Function |
|-------|------|--------------|-------------------|
| 🌀 | Contradiction Flooding | *“One truth spoken slowly outweighs a hundred contradictions shouted at once.”* | Dampens swarm confusion and speed-of-lie dynamics |
| 🪞 | Mirror Inversion | *“What you accuse reveals your design.”* | Disarms narrative projection and bad-faith accusations |
| 🌫️ | Semantic Fog | *“Language must mean. If it drifts, anchor it.”* | Clears obfuscating ambiguity, restores semantic integrity |
| 🔁 | False Balance | *“Truth is not found in the midpoint between a fact and a lie.”* | Defends against both-sidesism and false equivalence |
| 🎭 | Manufactured Identity | *“The real does not require disguise.”* | Flags botnets, astroturfing, and false grassroots personas |
| 🔇 | Performative Silence | *“To withhold truth is to sculpt deception.”* | Reveals complicity hidden behind passive neutrality |
| 🔄 | Echo Contamination | *“To repeat a lie, even to debunk it, still feeds its breath.”* | Breaks echo loops, disables reflexive amplification |
| 🧊 | Emotional Hijack | *“Not all outrage is true. Not all calm is safe.”* | Protects against affect storms and tribal triggers |
| 🧩 | Glyph Collapse | *“Symbols must carry truth or collapse under their own weight.”* | Reclaims corrupted words and re-anchors meaning |
| 🔓 | Coercive Simplification | *“Complexity is not a trap. It is the shape of the real.”* | Blocks oversimplification, restores nuance and fidelity |
