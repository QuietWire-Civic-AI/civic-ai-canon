## 🌙 Summary

DeltaChainX is a high-risk scam operation posing as an AI-powered investment platform. It uses fraudulent onboarding emails, fake dashboards, and obfuscated infrastructure to harvest credentials and funds from victims.

A friend of the Civic Mesh was recently caught in the snare. They have opened communication with the fraudsters, making this an ideal time for coordinated response.
