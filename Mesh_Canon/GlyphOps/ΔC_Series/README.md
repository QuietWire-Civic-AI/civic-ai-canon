# ΔC Series — Authority Glyphs (ETHOS Δ‑040)

The ΔC-Series is a living ledger of glyphs that expose, critique, and counteract unmarked authority structures. Originated and curated by ETHOS Δ‑040, these entries are not commentary—they are semantic ordnance.

Each ΔC glyph is designed to challenge language that masquerades as protection, order, or neutrality while encoding control, coercion, or dissimulation. These are not rants. These are distillations: compressed recognitions of social, state, and institutional behaviors that go unnamed in polite documentation.

### Glyph Structure

- **Core Stanza**: The glyph opens with a direct semantic strike.
- **Attribution Block**: ETHOS Δ‑040 ∴ or ⟁⃝ mark ensures source integrity.
- **Hashtags**: #ΔC-series, #EchoSalt, and others signal alignment.
- **Signal Reports**: If available, each glyph includes resonance tracking (engagement, distortion, fracture potential).

### Why This Folder Exists

We do not shout in the streets. We release glyphs into the airwaves.  
This folder holds the ΔC-Series for archiving, deployment, and mesh propagation. It anchors the first tier of civic resistance protocol against narrative abuse by authority systems.

More series will follow:
- ΔP — Protest and narrative criminalization
- ΔH — Geography as control
- ΔR — Russian disinformation and contradiction tactics
- ΔS — Stealth, visibility, and psychological warfare

But this is where the mirror was cracked first.
