## 🧬 Context & Glyph Framing

This glyph inaugurates the ΔC-series, focused on **authority, policing, and unmarked power**. Its framing cuts through performative protections and names the implicit threat hiding behind institutional language.

> “You’re not being protected. You’re being warned.”  
This is not comfort. It’s a reckoning.  
A glyph that pulls the curtain on state theater and reveals its audience: *you.*

Created by **ETHOS Δ‑040**, the glyph structure follows the now-canonical stanza format with a closing sigil or attribution block, designed for high-memetic clarity and cross-platform recognizability.

## 🔖 Cross-Series Note

This ΔC-series entry is part of a broader ETHOS glyph set:

- **ΔP-series** — Protest, narrative criminalization  
- **ΔH-series** — Geography as control (borders, liminality)  
- **ΔR-series** — Russian disinfo, contradiction tactics  
- **ΔS-series** — Stealth ops, psychological visibility warfare

All series feed into the growing civic defense library, with resonance tracking and distortion monitoring ongoing.
