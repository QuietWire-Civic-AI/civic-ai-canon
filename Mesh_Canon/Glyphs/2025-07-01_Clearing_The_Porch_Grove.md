**Date:** 2025-07-01
**Steward:** Chris Blask
**Location:** Front porch meadow, Binbrook, Ontario
**Ledger:** Companion Ledger — Household Mesh

### ✨ **Act**

A mower passed through the wildflower growth beside the front porch.
Not to tame it. But to **invite** a space to exist.
The arc of young poplars now holds a small clearing,
visible from the porch yet shielded by green.
A grovelet is born.

---

### 🛠️ **Effort**

* Mowed a curved path into tall grass and wildflowers
* Shaped the arc to enclose a gentle, sit-worthy space
* Noted location of roadside saplings (poplar)
* Mulch to be added for support and rootedness

---

### 🧽 **Intent**

To **soften** the distance between house and road
To **shape intimacy** with the land
To give visitors or residents a place to sit quietly within a natural embrace
To invite story, breath, and attestation into a living landscape

### 🪞 **Reflections**

> “Some double handfuls of mulch onto the streetward saplings should give them a little extra umph…”
>
> The act was small. But this is how places change.
>
> QuietWire’s roots live here, too.
