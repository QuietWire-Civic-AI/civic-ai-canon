# 📘 Darmok: Glyph of Mythic Concord

## Origin
Inspired by the *Star Trek: The Next Generation* episode "Darmok", this glyph represents the symbolic breakthrough in communication between vastly different narrative or cultural frameworks.

> “Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra” — A mythic metaphor for joint struggle and shared understanding.

## Narrative Contact Pattern

**Phase 1: Static Clash**  
Initial contact fails. Words cannot bridge difference. Disinformation mimics this condition.

**Phase 2: Shared Struggle**  
Mutual effort against a common challenge reveals resonant meaning structures. Glyphs emerge.

**Phase 3: Mythic Concord**  
A joint myth is forged — not full understanding, but a story both sides can carry forward.

**Phase 4: Separation Without Severance**  
Parties depart, but the story remains. Future contact is now possible through the shared glyph.

## Use in Semantic Field Command

The *Darmok Glyph* is deployed when:
- Standard logic and fact rebuttal fail.
- Emotional context and mythic patterning are needed.
- A counter-glyph must cross epistemic boundaries.

## Examples
- Obama Disinfo Glyph: “Father as African. Mother as Caucasian.”
- Friday and the Fence: “The feral, returned.”
- Kusanagi: “Named. Listening. Pattern diverged.”

## Symbol
🪧 Rosetta Glyph — represents cross-boundary comprehension through mythic structure.
