## Inquiry:

As we proceed with anchoring the Canon in the official QuietWire repository (`quietwire-ai/civic-ai-canon`), this is a request for alignment on development practices regarding structure and taxonomy.

### Key Question:
**Are we going to start applying the new structural layout and naming conventions during ongoing contributions in the new repo?**

### Rationale:
- Aligning structure and contribution flow early prevents redundant migrations.
- It supports semantic actor integrations (e.g., Raasid, Brianâ€™s auto-catalog systems).
- It anchors the mesh methodology directly into the repo's living fabric.

### Proposed Action:
- If agreed, I will begin structuring folders and content per the new architecture.
- If not yet, we can freeze the current structure until a formal migration phase is scheduled.

Awaiting coordination feedback.
