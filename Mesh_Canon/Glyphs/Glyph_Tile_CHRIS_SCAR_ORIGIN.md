### 🩸 What Happened

A child, freshly aware of his body’s vulnerability, receives an injury.  
It heals — but does not vanish.

Upon asking whether the mark will go away, the answer is:  
> “Never.”

This becomes the first moment of reckoning with permanence.

---

### 🪞 Meaning

- The beginning of personal scar awareness.
- The introduction of **irreversibility**.
- Early recognition that the body, like the self, accumulates time.

The scar fades physically but deepens metaphorically — it becomes a **living connection** between child and adult self.
