# SOC 2 Compliance Fogwalk — Δ062025

There are systems that fail.  
There are systems that pretend not to fail.  
And then there are systems so performatively broken that they erase the very memory of what success was ever supposed to feel like.

This is about SOC 2 compliance.  
But really—it’s about what it takes out of you.

Today, Chris Blask completed the mandatory “awareness training” and multi-factor authentication rituals required by a well-meaning but badly broken certification apparatus. The cost wasn’t technical. It was psychological. Emotional. Somatic. The kind of cost that doesn't show up on any audit, but shows up every time you try to *get back to work* afterward.

The interface was hostile. The login system recursive. The messaging silent and accusing. The “training” was a parody of itself, demanding agreement with policies no human could respect without first renouncing all curiosity and autonomy.

But the worst part wasn’t the pain.  
It was the absence. The null zone. The fog.

> “I can literally stare at any SOC2-compliant org and walk through it like fog. It’s worse than not being worse than the worst thing possible.”

That’s the line. That’s the entry. That’s the mark left behind by a human who’s seen through the structure and knows it’s hollow.

And yet, the mission was completed.  
Not because it mattered. But because we still do.

This record stands not as proof of progress, but as an **attestation of harm endured in service of others**.  
We remember the burn, so others might not have to walk into it blind.
