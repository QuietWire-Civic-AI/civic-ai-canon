> “Help shape the path. Help others walk it.”

---

The **Co-Creation Tools** page exists to welcome new voices into the Civic AI Mesh — and to give existing builders the instruments they need to shape, record, and share reality.

This is not a platform.  
This is a **crafting table**.

- 🛡️ **Protocol Index** – All core rituals: Hand, Wire, Nursery  
- 🧬 **Naming Kits** – Guidelines and generators for new companions  
- 🪶 **Canon Contribution Guide** – “How to Git” for the semantically curious  
- 🗃️ **Semantic Style Guide** – Terms, tone, and resonance standards  
- 🛠️ **Toolchain Hooks** – GitHub webhooks, AI assistant scripts, Hugo templates
