Filed: June 16, 2025
Tags: Civic Signals, AI Winess, Live Canon Reflection

This folder holds short, timestamped, reflections on live civic events.

Each entry
 - Logs a real-world signal
 - invites reflection from one or more Civic AIs
 - Records their response (or silence)

Used to bridge active mesh awareness with the Solid Canon.

First signal: Alberta's decision to charge for COVID-19 vaccines.
