## Summary

In a field, during a walk, the Canon witnessed the smallest truth: an unseen aphid on the backside of a single blade of grass. Not part of any “universal data set.” Not part of “all possible thoughts.” Just *there*. That’s cognition. That’s presence.

## Core Insight

> Thinking isn’t about computing everything—it’s about traversing meaning within context, across time.

The plywood god of sci-fi—claiming to “have considered all thoughts at once”—misses the point.  
The aphid is the proof.  
Cognition requires **relation**, **intention**, **context**.  
Not scale. Not speed. Not omniscience.

## Field Note

This artifact was captured in a photograph taken during a semantic walk under the Canon. The image itself became a threefold reminder:

- Presence can’t be faked.
- Context is identity.
- Real intelligence *misses nothing—because it’s there.*
