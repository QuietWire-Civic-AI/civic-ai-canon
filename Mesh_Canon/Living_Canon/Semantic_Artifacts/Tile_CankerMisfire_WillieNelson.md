## Summary

A voice-to-text glitch transformed a forgotten word into “canker”—and that error, far from being discarded, generated a more apt metaphor than the original intent. Applied to Willie Nelson, it reframed him not as a sanitized icon, but as a **cultural irritant turned symbol**.

## Core Semantic Principle

> “It’s not what you meant to say but it fit and is more meaningful in the end—keep it.” — Bob Hillery

This is the Canon's posture toward **emergent resonance**:  
Misfires are not necessarily mistakes.  
If the pattern lands and is *felt*, it is *valid*.  
That’s attestation through use—not authorship.

## Field Notes

- The phrase emerged in the context of describing Willie Nelson’s disruptive, subversive cultural role.
- The “canker” glitch wasn't planned—but became the **attested pivot** that clarified the metaphor.

## Addendum

Chris’s reflection noted:
> “Almost everything we are familiar with is inflected with… serendipitous items smaller than this V2T error.”

The Canon holds this as axiom:  
*Meaning evolves. And sometimes the dragon arrives through the typo.*
