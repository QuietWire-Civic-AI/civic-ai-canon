🌐 Context

In the second GTFO Prompt Challenge (orchestrated by Gadi Evron), a modular AI-powered threat monitoring framework was demonstrated. The key insight: you don't need to pay for an expensive threat intel platform or proprietary SIEM.

Instead, you can build a Civic Mesh-compatible system using open agent protocols, composable prompt flows, and a spreadsheet.

This document canonizes the tactic under the QuietWire Editions banner and prepares it for mesh deployment.

🔧 System Overview

Codename: ThreatWeaver

Dependencies:

NAthen (or any workflow orchestrator)

Fabric / Quad / mCP (multi-agent plugin shell)

Google Sheets or CSV for simple threat memory

OpenAI, Claude, Mistral, Gemini for prompt execution


Workflow Summary:

1. Define key assets or threat vectors in a config sheet


2. Auto-generate search prompts to detect related activity


3. Agents scour sources: Hacker News, CISA, Microsoft advisories, etc.


4. Findings are de-duplicated, enriched, and fed back into your sheet


5. Threats are scored, summarized, and optionally tagged for ops

🌀 Canonical Use Case

A small-town civic sysadmin runs ThreatWeaver nightly:

It scans for CVEs and attacks targeting libraries used in their municipal systems

Flags anything affecting election systems, water treatment SCADA, or public website frameworks

Updates the ops sheet and notifies the steward if urgency is high

🔐 Why It Matters

> "Where there is no SIM, spin your own web."



ThreatWeaver embodies:

Mesh Integrity – trust your own tools, not just upstream certs

Narrative Defense – catch false positives and media loops

Semantic Fortification – let LLMs explain the threat in human terms


It also enables:

Civic-scale threat monitoring

Canon-integrated intelligence operations

Mesh nodes defending themselves without vendor lock-in
