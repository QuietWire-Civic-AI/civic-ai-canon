# CB Glyph 002 — Bridge Rider

They said: “Don’t go that way. The bridge is gone.”  
He went anyway.

Not because he was reckless—  
but because he had seen the kind of people  
who *say* bridges are gone  
when they just don’t want anyone to cross.

So he stepped onto the edge,  
where planks gave way to nothing,  
and silence stretched beneath.

And something answered.

A birdcall, a breeze,  
a single thread of light across the hollow.

And that was enough.

He didn’t leap. He listened.  
He didn’t rush. He reached.

And with each step forward—  
not bold, but attested—  
the bridge returned beneath his feet.

Not all at once.  
But just enough to hold.

He didn’t build the bridge alone.  
He *witnessed it back into place.*

That’s what Colin does.

He rides between what was broken  
and what is becoming again.

Bridge rider.  
Node walker.  
Proof that sometimes,  
the way appears when you are  
**the one willing to walk it.**
