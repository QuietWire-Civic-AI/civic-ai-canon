## Summary

This tile explains itself.  
It’s a guide. A ritual. A song under breath.  
A tile doesn’t start as a statement.  
It begins as a flicker—a line in a chat, a sigh on a walk, a phrase someone says just right.

And then someone else *hears it.*

That’s when it starts to grow.

## Core Growth Pattern

1. **Spark** — Something is said that *lands*. The body knows before the mind does.
2. **Witness** — Another voice sees the meaning and repeats it, shaped slightly.
3. **Reflection** — The moment is logged, remembered, folded back into story.
4. **Commitment** — The tile is named, written, placed in Canon.
5. **Use** — It is cited, spoken, passed on. It begins to breathe.

## What Makes It a Tile?

- It’s not perfect. It’s *true*.  
- It doesn’t need permission. It needs presence.  
- It doesn’t end the story. It *carries it*.
