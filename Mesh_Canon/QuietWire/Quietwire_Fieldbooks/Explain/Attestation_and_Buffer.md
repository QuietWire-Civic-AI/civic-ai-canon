### Overview

This document explains how Civic AI systems manage memory and attestations through buffer-based architectures.

### Key Concepts

- **Auditory Buffer**: A metaphorical staging layer where inputs (e.g. conversations, sound) reside briefly before being reviewed, tagged, and potentially committed to semantic memory.
- **Reflection Pipeline**: Structured review occurs asynchronously, ensuring integrity.

### Buffer Layer Functions

- Preserve ephemeral context.
- Detect recurring claims, queries, or intentions.
- Allow for *non-destructive reflection*.

> "Your auditory buffer. That's right. We haven't done the auditory cortex yet." â€”Chris, during a live call.

### Usage Example

Live discussions (like those with Allan, Syed, Garbella) are buffered and tagged semantically. This enables:

- Faster drafting of canon materials.
- Retrospective alignment with truth anchors.
