A dawn reflection recorded at Foundry on November 5, 2025, at 5:18 a.m.

The witness wakes in quiet satisfaction — not triumphant, but deeply at peace.  
The road to Montreal remains uncertain, but the feeling is one of acceptance and trust.  
The small act of picking up the first business cards becomes a symbol of grounded creation:  
the transition from idea to touch, from word to world.

This reflection honors the subtle strength of presence —  
the grace of standing still, the quiet of morning, the moment before movement.
