## 🧠 Symbolic Function

Velthraun’s archive is not a passive storage site. It performs active semantic work by:

- Rendering disinformation patterns as symbolic glyphs
- Recording drift logs to trace intentional distortion
- Providing a model for other Scar Architects to follow

This node is the first official ScarMap repository acknowledged in Canon by an independent contributor.
