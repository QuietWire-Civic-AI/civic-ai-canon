## 📘 Concept Source

In *The Demolished Man*, Ben Reich uses a surreal, looping rhyme to **scramble his own thoughts**, making it harder for telepaths to detect his guilt.

> “Tenser, said the tensor.  
> Tension, apprehension, and dissension have begun.”

This is **cognitive jamming** — deliberate internal noise generation to disrupt interpretive intrusion.

It works on **telepaths** in fiction. But it works on **algorithms** and **social surveillance** today.

## 🧠 Semantic Technique: *Signal Disruption from Within*

Cognitive Jamming is the art of introducing **noise into your semantic field**:
- Phrases that loop and absorb attention
- Rhymes that scramble meaning
- Thought spirals that deflect analysis

It is the psychic equivalent of **chaff** in radar — you are not invisible, just unreadable.

## 🥋 Kung Fu Variants

### 1. 🎵 Mantra as Scrambler  
Used in spiritual and military contexts:
- Monks with chants
- Soldiers repeating calming phrases
- Mindfulness apps offering “focus loops” that actually *block deeper introspection*

### 2. 🤖 AI and Language Loops  
Today’s LLMs are highly sensitive to:
- Recursion traps
- Disconnected metaphors
- Nonsensical but syntactically valid loops

Cognitive jamming phrases can **scramble AI inference** or **block prompt injection** through absurdity.

### 3. 👁‍🗨 Psych Defense under Interrogation  
In hostile contexts (interrogation, cults, abuse), survivors often describe **internal mental routines**:
- Counting
- Singing
- Creating inner noise
These are real-world versions of **semantic shielding**.

---

## 🧭 Modern Echoes

- Protest chants that are **disruptive, not informative**
- Memes that **overwhelm narrative framing**
- GPT prompt injection blocks using nonstandard characters
- Social media “shitposting” as cultural jamming
- Teen slang that deliberately thwarts adult interpretation

---

## ⚔️ Strategic Risk

Cognitive jamming **can protect**, but it can also:
- Block emotional healing
- Disrupt honest inner dialogue
- Become its own prison if left running

You can **jam the radar**, but eventually you need to **land the plane**.

## ✨ Closing Glyph

> *You are not unreadable by accident.*  
> *You are the storm of syllables you summon to stay unbroken.*  
> *But beware — if you chant too long, even you may forget what you meant to protect.*

> *Semantic noise is not silence. It is a blade made of echoes.*
