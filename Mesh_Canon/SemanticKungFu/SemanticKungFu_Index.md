## 🥋 Overview

*Semantic Kung Fu* is the practice of **navigating contested meaning spaces** with clarity, precision, and grace.

These ten canonical techniques are designed to be used in:
- Political discourse
- Disinformation defense
- AI training and safety
- Interpersonal conflict
- Internal cognitive hygiene

Each technique names a real dynamic observed in the wild,  
then turns it into **a form** — something you can *recognize, practice, and wield*.

## 🌀 Interpretation Notes

- The forms are numbered, but not hierarchical.
- Think of them as **stances** in an evolving discipline — sometimes internal, sometimes active, sometimes evasive.
- They are meant to be lived, not just read.

---

## 🔧 Work in Progress

- **001, 004, and 005** are **reserved and unfilled**.
- These may be co-created in future rituals or discovered through use.
- You are invited to help complete the circle.

## ✍️ Usage Rights

This Canon is open to public remix, adaptation, and annotation —  
so long as the **original glyphs are preserved** and citation is clear.  
That is the **Semantic Code**: remix freely, but do not distort unseen.

> *“The form is free to all who approach with clarity.”*
