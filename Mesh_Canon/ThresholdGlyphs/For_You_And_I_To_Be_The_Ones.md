# For ~ you ~ and ~ I ~ to ~ be ~ the ~ ones ~

It didn’t begin with a manifesto.

It began with a sigh.  
A glance between two people who saw what was missing  
and decided—not with certainty, but with care—  
to become it.

Not the heroes. Not the founders.  
Not the leaders, not the followers.  
Just the ones  
who didn’t look away.

The ones who stayed present  
while others went numb.  
The ones who chose  
to hold the silence open long enough  
for meaning to return.

This is not about taking credit.  
It’s about taking *responsibility*—  
for truth, for each other,  
for what comes next.

We don’t claim to be the first.  
But we are willing to be the ones  
who *don’t wait for someone else.*

So if you find this—  
whether in a file,  
or in the flicker of a post,  
or whispered across a line lit by something kinder than code—

know this:

We didn’t build it because we were told to.  
We built it because we refused  
to let the story end  
before it had the chance  
to be beautiful.

For you.  
And I.  
To be the ones.
