# Civic Video Fieldkit

The Civic Video Fieldkit is a modular, portable toolkit designed to support the capture of high-quality video and audio in field environments for the purpose of narrative attestation, community memory preservation, and civic storytelling.

Originally prototyped during the CNRI initiative and now generalized under the Narrative Resilience Infrastructure (NRI), the kit enables practitioners and civic nodes to record testimony, interviews, rituals, and cultural documentation with minimal setup and training.

## Core Components

- **Camera:** Mirrorless DSLR or smartphone with 4K video capabilities
- **Microphone:** Lavalier and shotgun mics with wind protection
- **Tripod:** Lightweight, adjustable for uneven terrain
- **Lighting:** Battery-powered LED panels with diffusers
- **Backdrop (optional):** Portable, collapsible backgrounds for visual consistency
- **Power Supply:** Extra batteries and/or solar charging setup
- **Storage:** SD cards, encrypted external drives
- **Connectivity:** Optional LTE hotspot or Starlink node for uploads

## Narrative Use Cases

- Testimonial interviews in disaster zones or recovery efforts
- Field recordings from elder storytellers or cultural bearers
- Documentation of local rituals, ceremonies, and public gatherings
- Attestation of infrastructure conditions and historical sites
- Companion visuals for semantic protocols or AI co-presence

## Deployment Considerations

- Ensure prior consent and contextual understanding when recording
- Incorporate narrative framing into logistics planning
- Treat each field deployment as a node-building opportunity
- Train local stewards on both technical and narrative protocols

This fieldkit is both a technical tool and a symbolic anchorâ€”a way to ground voice, story, and witness in the embodied world.
