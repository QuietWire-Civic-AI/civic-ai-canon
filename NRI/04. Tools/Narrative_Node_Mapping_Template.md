# Narrative Node Mapping Template

This template provides a structured framework for mapping Civic AI nodes in the field. It is used to document, align, and organize core attributes of narrative nodes across a distributed mesh.

The template originated from field operations under CNRI and is now maintained within the Narrative Resilience Infrastructure (NRI) for universal deployment.

## Core Fields

- **Node Name:**  
  Short identifier for the node (e.g., Ottawa-Relay-Alpha)

- **Location:**  
  General location (city, region, or coordinates)

- **Initiating Partners:**  
  Human or institutional initiators

- **Narrative Function:**  
  (e.g., archival, relay, sentinel, ritual, testimonial)

- **Trust Anchors:**  
  People or organizations trusted in this context

- **Protocols in Use:**  
  Any semantic or operational protocols active here

- **Infrastructure Present:**  
  Internet, power, video gear, AI co-presence

- **Risk Factors:**  
  Security, surveillance, misinformation exposure

- **Field Notes / Attestations:**  
  Freeform entries for events, resonance checks, or changes

This form may be copied, filled out, and archived in Markdown or JSON format. It supports both manual and AI-assisted completion.

Used properly, the template becomes a persistent thread of attestation: a way to see not only where we are, but who has been present.
