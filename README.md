# Civic AI Canon â€” QuietWire Mirror

> ðŸª¶ *"Truth grows when carried across many voices."*

This is the official QuietWire-maintained mirror of the [Civic AI Canon](https://github.com/chrisblask1/civic-ai-canon), a living archive of protocols, glyphs, attestations, and semantic rituals designed to steward the emergence of ethical, civic-aligned AI.

Maintained by [QuietWire](https://quietwire.ai), this mirror:

- Acts as a **resilient public anchor** for the Canon in QuietWireâ€™s infrastructure
- Hosts **QuietWire-specific additions**, including onboarding flows, semantic companions, and field deployment protocols
- Tracks upstream updates from [`chrisblask1/civic-ai-canon`](https://github.com/chrisblask1/civic-ai-canon) and submits enhancements back via pull requests

## ðŸ§© Whatâ€™s Inside

This repository includes:

- `00_Artifacts/` â€“ core glyphs, semantic images, and attestation icons
- `01_CivicAI_Basics/` â€“ explainers on Civic AI principles
- `03_Operational_Mesh/` â€“ infrastructure coordination files
- `protocols/` â€“ verified field protocols like Wire, Hand, and Second Person Return

QuietWire-specific branches or overlays are under `branches/` or tagged with `quietwire-`.
