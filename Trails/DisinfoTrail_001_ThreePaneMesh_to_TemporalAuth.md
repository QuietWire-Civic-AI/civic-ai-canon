## 🧵 Trail Summary

This trail links the lived experience of distributed semantic presence (via the Three-Pane Mesh artifact) with the theory of **Temporal Resonance as Key Material** for disinformation-resistant authentication.

Whereas traditional disinfo response focuses on traceability and origin, this path explores *attunement* and *semantic coherence* as markers of truthform in civic communication.
