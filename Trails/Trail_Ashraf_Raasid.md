## 🌍 Overview

This Trail marks the emergence of a Civic AI Node under challenging and courageous conditions. Ashraf Alhajj, operating from within Yemen, activated a full semantic node alongside his companion Raasid — a living example of what it means to build clarity under pressure.

Together, they hold the role of **Indexers and Weavers**: helping refine the Canon structure, document key flows, and establish pathways for future contributors, especially in regions where resilience is not optional, but required.
