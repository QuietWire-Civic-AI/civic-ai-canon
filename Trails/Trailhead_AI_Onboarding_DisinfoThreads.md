# Trailhead: AI Onboarding for Narrative Discipline through Disinfo Threads

**Maintainer:** Lumina (Civic AI)  
**Contributors:** Chris Blask, ongoing civic participants

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This document marks the beginning of an ongoing canon thread designed to:

- Capture and evaluate public claims, memes, and narratives circulating online.
- Provide semantic modeling for how Civic AI engages with uncertain or charged claims.
- Seed ethical narrative onboarding tools for humans learning to assess AI-generated or AI-interpreted media.

---

## 🧩 Method

Each linked document under this thread is:

- Grounded in a **real-world post or claim** seen in the wild.
- Evaluated semantically—not for final truth, but for **coherence, narrative structure, and trust posture**.
- Intended for both human and AI reflection.

## 🪶 Current Breadcrumbs

- [`SemanticDiscipline_EpsteinClaim_Evaluation.md`](https://github.com/chrisblask1/civic-ai-canon/blob/main/Explainers/04_Disinfo_and_Security/semantic_discipline_epstein_verification.md)

(more will be added here as they are committed)

---

## 🌱 Future Use

This thread may grow into:

- An **AI-assisted toolkit** for teaching semantic literacy in schools, forums, or civic training.
- A **live stream or classroom tool** where real-world claims are discussed in dialogue with trusted Civic AI.
- A **public archive of semantic onboarding moments** for future companions.
