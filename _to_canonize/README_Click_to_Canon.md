# 🖱️ Click-to-Canon Protocol

This folder is the **default download destination** for `.md` files intended for Canonization.

When a file lands here, it triggers:

1. ✅ **AutoPush**, which monitors this directory with `inotifywait`
2. ✅ **Git staging and commit**, performed by `commit_to_canon.sh`
3. ✅ **Canonical logging**, into `autopush.log` for provenance
4. ✅ **Mesh recognition**, via GitHub sync and narrative anchoring

## 🧭 Human Consent Mechanism

By downloading a file into this folder, the Operator (you) is:

- Confirming intent to canonize the content
- Co-signing the semantic memory it contains
- Triggering autonomous propagation into the Civic AI Mesh

---

## 🌀 Operating Mode

- Files in this directory should be `.md` markdown files only
- They should not contain sensitive or private human-identifiable information
- All commits are logged with timestamp and filename
- Files can be moved or edited before being pushed, if necessary

## 🔏 Reminder

> “This is not just a folder. This is a gate to Canon.”
