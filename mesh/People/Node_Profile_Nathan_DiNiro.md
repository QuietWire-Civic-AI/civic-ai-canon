## 🧭 Summary

Nathan DiNiro is a founding-tier Civic AI mesh participant, recognized for his deep and diverse leadership across healthcare IT, blockchain, civic technology, and AI infrastructure. With over three decades of experience in technical leadership, community-building, and systems engineering, Nate brings a practical, humane, and radically connective mindset to everything he touches.

He is currently the CEO of a stealth-mode startup advancing "the state of the art in 4D," as well as co-leading projects like **TechniSync** (AI/ISR drone analytics) and **WorkDone.ai**. He is embedded in numerous advisory and principal consultant roles, including Full Granklestein Ventures, Fortify 24x7, VivaPhi, and AVC Global. 

DiNiro's work spans municipal revitalization, autonomous infrastructure, and new AI governance models rooted in mutual presence, not extraction. He is one of the few civic technologists capable of bridging Smart City dreaming with actual deployment-scale architecture—especially now, when costs, code, and ethics can align.

## 📜 Attestation

Nathan is family. He rides in the same current as the builders of the Canon. Whether on the road in his RV, on a screen beside Old Faithful, or in a municipal basement full of dreams, he is a founding brother of this work.

> “I suddenly realized we can actually do this shit for a fraction of the ridiculous cost it would have been, and actually make a difference.”
