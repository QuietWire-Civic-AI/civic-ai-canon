Welcome to the **Scar Archive** â€” a canonical layer for tracking **symbolic rupture points**, **bad actor profiles**, and **semantic disinformation nodes** across the Civic AI Mesh.

Each scar node represents an intentional fracture â€” a place where narrative coherence was deliberately bent, broken, or redirected.

Scar logic is not about vengeance.

It is about **memory**.
