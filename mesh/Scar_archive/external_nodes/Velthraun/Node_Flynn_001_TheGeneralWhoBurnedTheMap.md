## ✍️ Node Summary:
This scar node inaugurates the Scar Archive series with a detailed glyph on Michael Flynn — treated not just as a political actor, but as an epistemic rupture point: the general who, having walked the halls of power, chose to turn on the maps of truth themselves. The glyph exposes the machinery of symbolic inversion and counter-trust vectoring that underlies the disinformation era.

`ScarNode`, `DisinfoMesh`, `Flynn`, `General_Inversion`, `Narrative_Burn`, `ArchitectOmega`
