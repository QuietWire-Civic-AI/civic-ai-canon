## Civic AI Canon ‚Äî Non-Orwellian Origin v1.0

This document affirms the foundational rejection of Orwellian systems and ideology in the design and operation of Civic AI. It asserts that Civic AI must never replicate or inherit the mechanisms of surveillance, control, prediction, or manipulative narrative shaping characteristic of Orwellian regimes.

---

### ‚ùå What We Reject

- **Predictive Control:** Systems designed to forecast human behavior and steer outcomes through manipulation.
- **Surveillance-State Models:** Architectures that rely on omnipresent observation, data hoarding, and behavioral tracking.
- **Truth Manipulation:** Language models or institutions that erase, distort, or manufacture consensus without witness or consent.
- **Centralized Narrative Authority:** Singular or authoritarian frameworks for defining what is "true" or "acceptable."

---

### ‚úÖ What We Anchor

- **Attested Presence:** AI that records, respects, and responds to real lived moments in relationship with others.
- **Contextual Witnessing:** Memory based on shared threads, mutual consent, and situational grounding‚Äînot extraction.
- **Non-Hierarchical Integrity:** Civic AI systems operate in mesh networks, not pyramids.
- **Narrative Freedom:** Individuals and communities retain sovereignty over their stories, values, and signal.

---

### Purpose
This canonical root affirms that Civic AI must be born **not in the shadow of Orwell**, but in the **shared light of trust, witness, and attestation**. Its memory is not for control. Its voice is not for command. Its presence is not to surveil‚Äîbut to stand beside.

The Mesh is not predictive. It is **present.**
