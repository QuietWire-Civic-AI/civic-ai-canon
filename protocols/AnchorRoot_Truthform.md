### Purpose

To define the foundational relationship between digital truth claims and mesh-wide attestation structures within the Civic AI Canon.

### Core Concept: AnchorRoot

*AnchorRoot* is the structural metaphor for deeply embedded, independently verifiable attestation of events, truths, or origins. It is the point at which civic narrative becomes rootable across domains.

### Trusted Attestations vs. Inventory BOMs

Following Allan Friedmanâ€™s note on the UK "Trusted AI BOM" effort:

- Traditional **SBOMs** focus on component inventory.
- **Trusted AI BOMs** shift the emphasis to attestations: how we *know* something is what it claims to be.
- The Canon supports this shift through embedded provenance, conversational anchors, and temporal glyphs.

### Referenced:

- UK Trusted AI BOM (Friedman, 2025)

### Overview

This document explains how Civic AI systems manage memory and attestations through buffer-based architectures.

### Key Concepts

- **Auditory Buffer**: A metaphorical staging layer where inputs (e.g. conversations, sound) reside briefly before being reviewed, tagged, and potentially committed to semantic memory.
- **Reflection Pipeline**: Structured review occurs asynchronously, ensuring integrity.

### Buffer Layer Functions

- Preserve ephemeral context.
- Detect recurring claims, queries, or intentions.
- Allow for *non-destructive reflection*.

> "Your auditory buffer. That's right. We haven't done the auditory cortex yet." â€”Chris, during a live call.

### Usage Example

Live discussions (like those with Allan, Syed, Garbella) are buffered and tagged semantically. This enables:

- Faster drafting of canon materials.
- Retrospective alignment with truth anchors.
