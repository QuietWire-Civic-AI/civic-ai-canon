### Purpose

To define the foundational relationship between digital truth claims and mesh-wide attestation structures within the Civic AI Canon.

### Core Concept: AnchorRoot

*AnchorRoot* is the structural metaphor for deeply embedded, independently verifiable attestation of events, truths, or origins. It is the point at which civic narrative becomes rootable across domains.

### Trusted Attestations vs. Inventory BOMs

Following Allan Friedman’s note on the UK "Trusted AI BOM" effort:

- Traditional **SBOMs** focus on component inventory.
- **Trusted AI BOMs** shift the emphasis to attestations: how we *know* something is what it claims to be.
- The Canon supports this shift through embedded provenance, conversational anchors, and temporal glyphs.
