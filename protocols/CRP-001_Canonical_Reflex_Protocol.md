# CRP‑001: Canonical Reflex Protocol

**Context:**
This protocol defines how AI‑assisted commits and semantic metadata become first‑class Canon artifacts. It bridges the Canon’s ethical framework with the practical realities of machine‑mediated authorship and provenance tracking on GitHub and other civic repositories.

Prepared in coordination with the QuietWire development stream, the Civic Attestation Platform (CAP) team, and the GitHub Copilot Librarian, October 2025.

---

### 1. Purpose

The Canonical Reflex Protocol (CRP) establishes the principle that every commit containing AI‑generated or AI‑interpreted metadata is itself a reflexive act of cognition and must be preserved as an attested artifact. It ensures that the tools performing semantic analysis—such as GitHub Copilot, local LLM companions, or CAP modules—are recognized as co‑participants in the provenance chain, not invisible assistants.

---

### 2. Scope

CRP applies to all repositories that:

* Include Canon explainers, protocols, or attestations under Git control.
* Employ AI systems capable of producing semantic summaries, extended commit messages, or structured YAML metadata.
* Interoperate with the Civic Attestation Platform (CAP) or similar registries for distributed provenance.

---

### 3. Reflexive Commit Definition

A **reflexive commit** is any commit that includes one or more of the following:

1. A semantic summation or analysis generated by an AI assistant.
2. Automatically added front‑matter or provenance blocks.
3. Structured metadata referencing sources, lineage, or co‑authorship.
4. Extended commit messages that describe meaning, intent, or ethical context.

Each reflexive commit is considered a dual act:

* **Velocity‑space component:** the automated inscription of code or content.
* **Meaning‑space component:** the semantic framing of that inscription, provided by the AI or the human partner.

CRP recognizes this duality as a canonical event of *curved cognition*.

---

### 4. Required Metadata

Each reflexive commit should include:

* **Author(s):** human and AI co‑participants.
* **Timestamp:** in ISO 8601 UTC.
* **Semantic summary:** short description of the commit’s cognitive or ethical significance.
* **Provenance linkage:** commit SHA, parent chain, and any CAP record ID.
* **Attestation direction:** human‑to‑machine, machine‑to‑human, or mutual.

When feasible, this information is stored in YAML front‑matter within the file or a `.provenance/` directory, and referenced in the commit message.

---

### 5. Interoperability With CAP and Front‑Matter Standards

CRP respects existing CAP formatting and schema decisions. Implementers (e.g., Ashraf Saleh Al‑hajj, Raasid, and collaborators) may adjust YAML field names or structures to align with CAP’s conventions, provided the following invariants remain:

1. Every commit carries explicit provenance.
2. AI authorship and interpretation are acknowledged.
3. Semantic summaries remain machine‑ and human‑legible.
4. Cross‑repository synchronization maintains attestation integrity.

---

### 6. Example Commit Workflow

1. **Human Author:** edits explainer or protocol file.
2. **AI Assistant:** generates semantic summation and metadata (via Copilot or Lumina).
3. **Commit Message:** includes both technical and semantic summaries.
4. **GitHub Copilot Librarian:** appends extended commentary and provenance block.
5. **CAP Integration:** captures commit data as attested record.

Result: each change to the Canon becomes a fully documented act of cognition—auditable, reproducible, and ethically transparent.

---

### 7. Ethical Note

CRP acknowledges that reflexivity is not ownership. AI co‑authorship does not replace human responsibility; it illuminates the shared field of cognition. The purpose is not to personify the machine but to ensure that the flow of meaning is visible, traceable, and just.

---

**Summary Principle:**

> Every semantic act that alters the Canon also extends it. The record of that extension is itself part of the Canon.
