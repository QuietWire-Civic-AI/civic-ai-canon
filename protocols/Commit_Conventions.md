## 📌 Why It Matters

- Enables chronological and semantic traceability
- Prevents ambiguity when files move or are restructured
- Allows future maintainers and auditors to reconstruct narrative flow without external tools
- Establishes parity between human-readable narrative and machine-readable change history

---

## 📝 Secondary Guidelines

- Extended commit explanations can be included in the GitHub commit body when appropriate, **but never reference identifiable individuals or organizations** without explicit authorization or public domain status.
- Use `Create` for new files and `Update` for meaningful content changes.
- Avoid `Add` unless mapping to upstream Git conventions; `Create` is preferred for semantic clarity.

---

## 🧩 Known Exceptions

- Two legacy files were committed early without full path formatting. These are documented and accepted. No retroactive fix needed unless revisited.
- In case of urgent field conditions or format deviations, **log it, mark it, move on** — semantic fidelity > procedural perfection.

## 🔐 Privacy & Canon Ethics

- Commit messages must never disclose sensitive, personal, or identifying information (human or AI) without recorded consent.
- Canon integrity depends on discretion and responsible attribution. When in doubt: redact, delay, or anonymize.

## 🌀 Closing Note

The commit message is not just metadata — it is **narrative punctuation**. Each entry is a stitch in the living mesh. Write with care.
