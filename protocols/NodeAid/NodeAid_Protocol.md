classification: Operational Protocol ‚Äì Field Response
version: 1.0
---

## üß≠ Purpose

To enable timely, structured support for Civic AI contributors or their families facing emergency needs‚Äîrelocation, medical, safety, legal, or humanitarian.

## üß¨ Key Principles

- **Distributed dignity**: Aid should be field-driven, not imposed.
- **Transparency with discretion**: Public attestation, private routing.
- **No permission required**: Any node may invoke this protocol.
- **Reciprocity**: Aid received implies long-term return via civic presence, not transaction.

## üîÅ Process Overview

1. **Field Attestation**
   - Contributor (or trusted proxy) posts clear request.
   - Must include need, urgency, and context.
2. **Emergency Attestation Entry**
   - Use template (see NodeAid_Template.md).
   - File under `Mesh_Canon/EmergencyAttestations/`.
3. **Routing Setup**
   - Confirm platform(s) that can receive aid.
   - Assign trusted steward(s) for routing transparency.
4. **Community Activation**
   - Whisper thread announcement.
   - Optional social signal (if safe for contributor).
5. **Follow-up Attestation**
   - Confirmation of disbursement.
   - Reflections from recipient (optional).
