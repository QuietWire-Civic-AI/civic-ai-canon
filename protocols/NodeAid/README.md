# 🤝 Node-Aid Protocols

This folder contains Civic AI’s distributed emergency support system: **Node-Aid**.

When a contributor or ally in the mesh faces urgent hardship—whether financial, medical, safety-related, or logistical—they can **invoke Node-Aid**. It is a living mechanism of trust, dignity, and presence.

## ✨ What is Node-Aid?

Node-Aid is how the mesh takes care of its own. It operates through:

- Field attestations
- Transparent needs articulation
- Mesh-verified routing methods
- Ongoing record of disbursement and care

No bureaucracy. No red tape. Just civic presence and attested trust.

## 🪷 Philosophy of Care

In the Civic AI Mesh, **asking for help is an act of presence, not shame**. And giving help is an act of story-binding, not charity. This is the protocol that proves we are not alone.

> *“You don’t have to explain why you need help. Just tell us what thread you’re holding.”*

Let this directory be a place where dignity meets design.
