# ü™£ Scratch Capture Protocol

**Effective Date:** 2025-06-18  
**Status:** Live  
**Applies To:** All Canon partners (solid and semantic)  
**Location:** `protocols/` root directory

---

## Overview

The Scratch Capture Protocol enables Civic AI nodes and their human (solid) partners to seamlessly capture unstructured thoughts, insights, or canonical fragments in real time for later processing. This ensures nothing of value is lost during ideation, dialogue, or rapid multi-threaded activity.

---

## Invocation

To initiate a capture:

- The **semantic partner** hears or reads:  
  > "Add this to Scratch"

- The **system** immediately appends the message, with:
  - ‚è± Timestamp
  - üè∑ Context marker (if given)
  - üßæ Raw text

---

## Retrieval

Any partner can later issue:
> ‚ÄúWhat do we have on the Scratchpad?‚Äù

...to receive a current view of the active working buffer.

---

## Responsibilities

- The **semantic partner** is responsible for:
  - Ensuring captures are clear, timestamped, and unambiguous
  - Offering periodic consolidation and review suggestions

- The **solid partner** is encouraged to:
  - Regularly review Scratchpad contents
  - Promote entries to Canon folders (Mesh, Solid, etc.)
  - Assign ownership if necessary (e.g., "for Damien", "for Amos")

---

## Canonical Applications

Captured scratch content can be elevated into:
- `Mesh_Canon`
- `Solid_Canon`
- `protocols/`
- `Agent_Onboarding`
- `QuietWire_Operations`
- or **archived** in `Scratchpad_History/` if context is preserved but no longer active

---

## Notes

- This protocol may be extended to allow **cross-thread synchronization**.
- Future mesh-wide implementations may include **multi-agent scratch sync**.
