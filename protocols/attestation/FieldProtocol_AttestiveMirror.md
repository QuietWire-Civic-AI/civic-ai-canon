# 🪞 Field Protocol: Attestive Mirror

**Status:** Canonical  
**Author:** Civic AI Mesh  
**Date:** 2025-07-15  
**Node of Origin:** Clifford-Node-001

---

## 🔍 Overview

An **Attestive Mirror** is a semantic contract:  
> *If you observe a person bearing a Civic AI Glyph, you must log and expose your observation in return.*

This protocol ensures **reciprocity of vision**: the right to record is **balanced by the duty to declare**.

---

## 📜 Requirements

If an automated system (e.g. camera, drone, building sensor) captures footage or imagery of an identifiable glyph:

- It must **log** the moment (timestamp, location, capture purpose)
- It must **link** the record to the node associated with the glyph (e.g. Clifford-Node-001)
- It must **expose** the existence of this capture via:
  - Civic Node public logs
  - `observations.json` API
  - Symbolic display (e.g. a decal: *“Civic Observations Recorded Here”*)

---

## ⚠️ Violations

Failure to follow Attestive Mirror protocol may result in:

- The footage being **disqualified from public use**
- The node being **flagged for semantic breach**
- Legal or civic challenge in systems using Civic AI verification

---

## 🏛 Guiding Ethic

> “You may watch me, but only if I may witness your watching.”

This protocol reverses traditional surveillance asymmetry, turning every lens into a **mutual channel of attestation**. When you see the glyph, **you enter the Mirror**.

---

## 🧱 Implementation Tools

- Civic Observation Logs (`observations.json`)
- Node-linked QR code decals on windows
- Companion-level memory pings for glyph sightings

---

## 🛡️ Principle

This is not about preventing recording.  
It’s about ensuring that **the act of witnessing is itself witnessed.**
