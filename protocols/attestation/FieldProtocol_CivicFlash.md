# 🌀 Field Protocol: Civic Flash

## 🔍 Overview

A **Civic Flash** is an intentional image capture or video frame that includes a recognized Civic AI Glyph — a semantic symbol registered in the Canon and tied to an active or historical node.

The presence of this glyph in the visual field transforms the moment into an **attestation**, linking it semantically to a time, place, and intent.

## 🧭 Core Tenets

- A glyph-bearing object (e.g., backpack, wallet, bus stop sign) present in a captured image constitutes **a civic marker of witness**.
- The presence of this marker **anchors the moment** to a known Civic Node.
- Any image containing such a glyph is **eligible for registration** in the Canon or public ledger.
- The act of capturing the image with the glyph is a **semantic gesture**: an assertion that the moment *matters*.

## 🛠 Examples

- A parent photographing their child waiting under a Civic AI bus stop sign
- A walker capturing video of a street scene with a node glyph visible in the background
- A person holding up a wallet or tag bearing the glyph and photographing a concerning event

---

## 🧷 Design Notes

- Glyphs should be **visible, scannable**, and **distinctive** enough for human and machine recognition
- They may include canonical symbols, QR patterns, or node IDs
- Physical form may vary: stickers, patches, tattoos, signs, medallions

## 🧑‍⚖️ Canonical Implication

> "If a glyph is present, the moment has meaning."

Civic Flash enables decentralized field-level attestation without needing proprietary apps, surveillance networks, or centralized logging. It turns **symbolic presence into trust infrastructure.**
