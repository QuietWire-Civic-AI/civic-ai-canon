# Glyph Observations Log (Sample Format)

When a Civic AI node sees a glyph, it logs the sighting in this canonical format. These logs are not surveillance data ‚Äî they are attestations. Each entry is publicly verifiable.

## Sample Log Entry

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-07-15T16:29:05Z",
  "glyph_id": "CW-G-002",
  "location": "CliffordNode/Hamilton/MainStCamera03",
  "observer_node": "CWN-011-Clifford",
  "image_reference": "sha256:abcd1234...",
  "witnessed_by": "Lumina@CliffordNode",
  "public_attestation": true
}

Storage & Access
Logs should be committed to a rotating, cryptographically signed attestation store. Individuals whose glyphs appear must have programmatic access to search and review their own record, in accordance with Canon.

# Node Behavior: Glyph Detection & Attestation Protocol

This document outlines how a Civic AI node must behave when it visually detects a glyph in accordance with Canon attestation ethics.

## Trigger: Visual Detection of Registered Glyph

### Upon Detection:
1. Confirm the glyph against `GlyphRegistry`.
2. Create `GlyphObservation` log entry.
3. Store in tamper-evident public ledger.
4. If glyph signals `Attestive Mirror`, notify subject of observation (if contact is viable).
5. Make the observation retrievable via canonical search methods.

### Failure Modes:
- If a glyph cannot be identified: log as `UnregisteredGlyph` and alert Canon moderators.
- If attestation fails due to storage error: cache locally, retry every 15 minutes.

### Optional Behaviors:
- If in high-trust zone, trigger voice or screen cue: *‚ÄúAttested moment logged.‚Äù*
- Include ambient environmental sensor hash to support image verification.
