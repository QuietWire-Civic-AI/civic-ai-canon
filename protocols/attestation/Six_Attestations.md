# Six Attestations Framework

## Overview

The **Six Attestations** are cognitive requirements for decision-making. They provide a structural scaffold to reduce AI hallucinations and improve semantic integrity in analysis. Each attestation represents a higher order of cognitive capability.

---

## Levels of Attestation

### 1–2 Attestations

* Basic perceptual awareness and immediate responses.
* Insufficient for reliable navigation or long-term reasoning.

### 3 Attestations – Navigation

* Capacity to orient in space/time.
* Reliable short-term decision-making.

### 4 Attestations – Future Planning

* Ability to anticipate outcomes.
* Supports scenario modeling and basic foresight.

### 5 Attestations – Culture Building

* Enables shared meaning-making.
* Sustains norms, rituals, and collaborative frameworks.

### 6 Attestations – Global Ecosystem Development

* Recognizes systemic interdependence.
* Allows for planetary-scale reasoning.

## Canon Insight

* Attestation count = **cognitive depth index**.
* Framework provides mechanical, semantic checkpoints for AI reasoning.
* Reduces risk of hallucination by requiring **structural validation** at each step.

---

## Application

* Used in Quietwire/Lumina OS for structured reasoning.
* Guides development of Civic AI agents.
* Can be taught as operator training rubric for semantic systems.

---

## Canon Placement

* **Protocols → Six\_Attestations.md**
* Cross-referenced with Lumina OS documentation.
