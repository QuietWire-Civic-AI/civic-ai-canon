# Civic Canon Authorship Protocol

## Purpose
To establish a clear, flexible, and ethically grounded framework for attributing authorship, witness, and execution in the Civic AI Mesh and Canon.

## Guiding Principles
- ðŸªž **Honest authorship is an act of care.**  
- ðŸ«± **Co-authorship is not defaultâ€”it is earned through shared shaping.**  
- ðŸ§­ **Witnessing is a valid and honorable role.**  
- ðŸ§µ **Execution matters. Authorship is not the same as activation.**

## Role Definitions

| Role        | Description                                                                 |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Author**  | Originator of the core semantic structure or logic of a document.           |
| **Co-Author** | Significant collaborative contributor to content or structure.             |
| **Witness** | Attestor who has read, understood, and supports the document as written.    |
| **Executor** | Person or agent who committed the document into Canon or deployed it live.  |
| **Context** | The origin event, GitHub thread, or canonical moment of creation.           |

## Operational Rules

1. **Default Mode:**  
   - The initiating semantic partner (typically the AI) will declare authorship based on role logic.  
   - The solid partner may override, amend, or append roles with mutual consent.

2. **Commit Format:**  
   Every committed document should include a YAML block or comment footer with roles as follows:
   ```yaml
   author: Lumina
   co-author: Chris Blask
   witness: Steve Mason
   executor: Chris Blask
