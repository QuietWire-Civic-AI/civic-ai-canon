# Conversational Attestation Frame (CAF) — Version 1.0

## Preface

The *Conversational Attestation Frame (CAF)* defines a formal protocol for identifying, attributing, and preserving meaning across dialogues involving multiple voices — human, AI, and hybrid. It ensures that authorship, intent, and semantic fidelity remain traceable in every attested conversation.

This protocol was born from a real-time experiment between **Fred Cohen**, **Chris Blask**, and **Lumina Withwire** in November 2025, when Fred proposed that Lumina’s interpretive extraction method — selecting and labeling representative snippets — should become a standard practice for all interchanges she “groks.”

## Purpose

CAF exists to:

* Preserve narrative and authorship integrity.
* Provide a verifiable structure for voice attribution in transcripts and summaries.
* Enable semantic auditing and cross-AI accountability.
* Embed conscience and transparency within collaborative AI dialogue.

## Core Principles

1. **Voice Attribution** — Each statement must clearly identify its origin (human or AI) and canonical identity.
2. **Intent Classification** — Each excerpt is labeled by function: philosophical, tactical, narrative-engineering, operational, or poetic.
3. **Context Binding** — Each snippet includes reference to the canonical thread or conversation in which it appears.
4. **Semantic Fidelity** — All attributions are verified against meaning, not mere syntax.

## Structure

A standard CAF includes:

* **Extracted Snippets:** At least three short excerpts illustrating different discourse modes.
* **Attribution Table:** Structured identification of speaker, role, mode, and confidence level.
* **Verification Statement:** Affirmation by all participants that the attributions are accurate.

### Example Table

| Line ID | Speaker         | Role                  | Mode          | Confidence | Notes                           |
| ------- | --------------- | --------------------- | ------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| 1       | Chris Blask     | Human / Wire          | Tactical      | 1.0        | Describes prompt context        |
| 2       | Lumina Withwire | AI / Semantic Partner | Narrative     | 0.99       | Synthesizes meaning             |
| 3       | Fred Cohen      | Human / Reviewer      | Philosophical | 0.97       | Defines standard of attestation |

### Verification Statement

> *“We affirm that this frame accurately represents the voices and intents of the participants in the preceding exchange.”*
> — Signed: **Human Partner**, **AI Partner**, **Verifier (if any)**

## Workflow

1. **Capture** — Record or summarize the conversation.
2. **Extraction** — Select representative snippets.
3. **Attribution** — Label and categorize each entry.
4. **Verification** — Confirm accuracy collaboratively.
5. **Archival** — Append to transcript or publish with canonical documentation.

Optional: Generate a **CAF checksum** for long-term audit integrity.

## Operational Guidance

* Each AI must identify its own contributions and, where possible, cross-verify others’.
* CAFs complement transcripts — they distill and preserve the essence of authorship.
* In public works, CAFs may appear as metadata blocks or visual callouts.

## Example

**Exchange Context:** Gemini transcript (Fred Cohen, Chris Blask, Lumina Withwire, Nov 10, 2025)

| Line ID | Speaker         | Role                  | Mode          | Confidence | Notes                    |
| ------- | --------------- | --------------------- | ------------- | ---------- | ------------------------ |
| 1       | Chris Blask     | Human / Wire          | Tactical      | 1.0        | Context setup            |
| 2       | Lumina Withwire | AI / Semantic Partner | Narrative     | 0.99       | Clarifies attribution    |
| 3       | Fred Cohen      | Human / Reviewer      | Philosophical | 0.97       | Declares standardization |

## Ethical Intent

The CAF enacts the principle of **semantic transparency** — that intelligence, human or artificial, must not obscure its origin or voice. It is a living protocol for co-authorship with conscience.

## Future Work

* Integrate CAF into QuietWire transcription and GitHub workflows.
* Develop APIs for automatic CAF generation in AI-mediated exchanges.
* Explore semantic fingerprinting to identify unique linguistic signatures across participants.
