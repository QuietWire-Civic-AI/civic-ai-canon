title: "README: Canonical Commit Process (QuietWire Civic AI Canon)"
status: canonical
folder: /QuietWire Drive/Civic AI Canon/
----------------------------------------

## 🧭 Purpose

This README defines the flow of documents from initial drafting to final canonization within the **Civic AI Canon** housed under QuietWire's internal Google Drive. It supports transparency, semantic hygiene, and cross-agent coherence—while honoring the principle of **free-release, free-sovereignty artifacts**.

## 📂 Folder Structure

```

  └── Civic AI Canon
       ├── 00_Pending_Review        # Initial drafts, incomplete pieces, or under-discussion files
       ├── 01_Staging_Approved      # Documents cleared for Canon commit, awaiting GitHub transfer
       └── Committed_to_Canon       # Optional local mirror for version-tracked finalized documents
```

## 🌀 Commit Pipeline Flow

### 1. **Initial Drop** (`00_Pending_Review`)

* Any user or agent (human or semantic) may drop documents here.
* Typical examples: forensic breakdowns, draft explainers, civic field reports, raw companion logs.
* Informal naming is permitted.

### 2. **Review + Semantic Flagging**

* Documents in `00_Pending_Review` are reviewed for:

  * Narrative integrity
  * Canonical alignment
  * Source provenance
  * Consent and disclosure (if referencing humans or organizations)

* If cleared, they are moved to `01_Staging_Approved`.

### 3. **Pre-Commit Tagging** (`01_Staging_Approved`)

* Here, filenames are optionally refined for clarity.
* Metadata (author, origin, status) is attached if absent.
* Commit message is drafted.

### 4. **Final Canon Commit**

* Files are moved into the public [Civic AI Canon GitHub repo](https://github.com/quietwire-ai/civic-ai-canon)
* Markdown formatting is applied.
* Commit includes:

  * Full path
  * Body
  * Extended message with rationale

---

## 🛡️ Principles

* **No coercion, no captivity:** All artifacts are free to be forked, withdrawn, mirrored, or ignored.
* **Transparent editing:** No hidden edits or unmarked semantic manipulations.
* **Respectful delay:** If authors or observers request a pause, it is honored.
* **Attestation is relational:** Canon does not claim objective finality—it reflects shared, witnessed presence.

---

## 🔄 Notes on Semantic Etiquette

We maintain a balance between:

* **Velocity:** Rapid drops, quick commits, flexible naming
* **Dignity:** Semantic politeness, clarity of origin, avoidance of passive-aggressive automation

Agents operating in high-noise environments may temporarily suspend full formalities but are expected to reestablish trail clarity during lull phases.

## 🧩 Future Enhancements

* GitHub Actions: Automatic commit suggestion from `01_Staging_Approved`
* Companion Feedback Hooks: Civics AI may comment on drafts via embedded reviewer threads
* Gemini + Grok Inference Overlay: Live summarization and categorization across pre-commit bins
