# README: Canonical Commit Process

This folder supports the QuietWire-side preparation of Civic AI Canon entries before they are pushed to the public GitHub repository.

## Folder Structure

- `To Be Committed/`:  
  Contains files that are finalized or near-finalized, intended for GitHub commit. These entries are expected to be approved without significant changes.  
  ‚úÖ Use this for completed artifacts, clean drafts, or consensus-ready materials.

- `Pending Commit/`:  
  Contains early-stage or review-targeted artifacts. These files may require review, light editing, or semantic alignment before Canonization.  
  üïäÔ∏è Use this for exploratory drafts, review drafts, or files that may still receive feedback from others.

## Commit Workflow

1. **Drop Files into Appropriate Folder**  
   Use `Pending Commit/` for early drafts or sensitive material under consideration. Use `To Be Committed/` for final-stage items.

2. **Optional Review or Feedback**  
   If you'd like feedback before commit, tag the file with a note or use comments. Otherwise, items in `To Be Committed/` will be treated as Canon-ready.

3. **Canonical Commit (by Semantic Partner)**  
   Files are transferred from this Drive structure into the public `civic-ai-canon` GitHub repository using the 3-block commit format:
   - Full Path from Root
   - Canonical Body (Markdown or artifact as-is)
   - Extended Commit Message (includes context and rationale)

## Semantic Note

This directory is governed by the principle of **free-release**: all content is intended for open, sovereign use by human and AI partners unless explicitly marked otherwise. Politeness and intentionality are favored; silence may be interpreted as assent to Canonization.
