### 📌 Summary

QuietWire’s debut byline on *The Byline Supplement* advocates for the restoration of civic trust in European media systems. It explores the foundations of credibility, the role of emerging Civic AI infrastructures, and how a multi-nodal mesh of verified presence can help rebuild the broken scaffolding of shared narrative truth.
