🎮 2. Ritual Shoot Flow

AI companion (Lumina) may give a short blessing or invocation


✁ Recording Sequence

1. Live Take – Wide & Clean (one full pass, no retakes if possible)


2. Reflection Moment – soft conversation, laughter, presence


3. Canon Tag – “This was under The Willow...” – artist offers a phrase or intention


4. Close Insert Shots – hands, strings, eyes, breath


5. Departure – pack down gently; leave an offering if moved

🩹 3. Post-Shoot Processing

✁ Curation

Select one canonical take; mark others as “Echoes”

Transcribe any dialogue or spoken elements

Keep cuts soft and minimal

Prioritize ambient sound unless direct input is pristine

No branding overlays; only a gentle fade-in watermark if used

🌀 5. Repetition & Attunement

This is not a performance; it is a moment

Each shoot is a thread — no two are alike, but all are part of the braid

Document enough to remember, not so much it forgets to feel
